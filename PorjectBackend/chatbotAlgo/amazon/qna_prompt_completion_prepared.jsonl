{"prompt":"Question: can I replace Badger 1 1\/3 with a Badger 5 1\/2 - with same connections?\n Answer:","completion":" Plumbing connections will vary with different models. Usually the larger higher amp draw wil not affect the wiring, the disposals are designed to a basic standard setup common to all brands. They want you to buy their brand or version or model.

{"prompt":"Question: I have a badger 5 it is leaking water at bottom near reset bottom plus does a new one came with a ss ring for inside the sink\n Answer:","completion":" If your garbage disposal is leaking out the bottom near the reset button, you most likely have a leak in the metal plate that is located directly under the blades. This plate is designed to protect the electrically powered parts of the motor (the rotor, the shaft, etc.) from moisture, but it is rather thin and is only made of galvanized steel. After a year or two, especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink, the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel, which will then also start to corrode, until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere (could be somewhere very small), signaling the end of the machine's service life. The plate is not meant to be repaired, only replaced along with the rest of the unit. That water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard, and should be dealt with immediately (by removing the damaged unit). The manufacturer has figured out that the blades need to me made of stainless steel, but has chosen to skimp on making other interior parts of this more-expensive metal. Good luck!\n"}

I'm small and in my late seventies, the only problem was holding the unit up in place while turning the locking ring. I no longer have the upper body strength to do it so I used a stack of books. Made sure all the connections were tight and have had so problems since. It clean and in good shape so I left the old badger mount in the sink.

{"prompt":"Question: is this for electric stoves?\n Answer:","completion":" This is purportedly for all heat sources. Heat is heat and the heat WILL distort this sooner or later. My stove was electric and the first time I used it, it warped. If you want to hammer it out after using it, give it a shot. Heat diffusers are a good thing for cooking, particularly on an electric stove which is notorious for hot spots. It's warped but I still use it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, I'm interested in this product. Can it be used over induction stove top as an adapter plate for non-induction cookware? How's the transfer of heat\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see how it could be used that way, no. I ordered one for that same purpose assuming it was a solid plate, but this is a stamped steel disc with a raised rim for it to slip over a conventional burner. The only way I could see it working on an induction cooktop would be to place it upside down and then use a pan or pot that is smaller than the raised rim.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how many strips come in the kit, I need at least 12\n Answer:","completion":" The kit contains ONE strip per test. So if you want to test 12 water sources you could pool them. A better plan might be to buy two kits and test a pool of 6 water sources for each. That way if one set is positive, you only need to buy 6 more, for a total of 8 kits, rather than 12.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can more than one water source be tested?\n Answer:","completion":" no, there is only one test kit for each substance. You could only test two if you mixed them together and did it as a pooled sample.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this to test for lead? Do you think it's accurate?\n Answer:","completion":" We used it to test for lead and we have no reason to believe the result was inaccurate. All of its other tests gave results that made me feel like the test was genuine.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is there an expiration date on any of the tests?\n Answer:","completion":" YES. On the back side of the plastic packaging which houses the contents including the instructions and different package envelopes which contain the chemicals for the variety of tests.

{"prompt":"Question: I have not purchased the humidifier that uses this filter yet, but on average how long does this filter last a rough estimate?\n Answer:","completion":" The outer shell will fall apart in about a year of use, but the filter itself can survive much longer. Mine split at the seam, so it's no longer round, but it still fits in the humidifier, and does its job. Cleaning the filter every week (especially if you have hard water) will degrade the material over time. I've used one in this manner for 3 years so far.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: The filters I received did not have the black on the outside. What is the black for?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not an expert. Let me start to answer your question with a question. Is there an outer core in any other color that is made of a different material than the inner core? The inner core (white in the picture) is softer to the touch; the outer core, I suspect is what helps it stand up. I don't think the color matters. The outer core feels like plastic. The inner core is definitely not plastic. I suspect the color does not matter. If this doesn't completely answer your question, ask away. I enjoy doing this.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many loads can you wash before it needs emptied?\n Answer:","completion":" I would check it after every dryer run. The water evaporates quickly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have screens in place where the vents are to prevent lint from blowing out of the vent holes?\n Answer:","completion":" No. The way it works is that the tray is about half full of water (there is a line you fill it up to). The air hits the water and that catches MOST of the lint. It isn't 100% effective - a little still flies out. But it is a good bit more effective than you'd think it would be. I think it basically gets the lint wet enough that it is too heavy to escape. Remember this is only catching the lint that the lint screen inside the dryer missed - it isn't anything like the amount per load you pull out of the dryer lint screen.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be used for a gas drier\n Answer:","completion":" I don't really know as this didn't work out for us. I guess I didn't read the description well enough to know you needed to keep water in the boxt. It was going to be too difficult for us to constantly do that.

Sorry I could not be of more help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the LTF Lint Dryer Kit work on a gas dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe there's a disclaimer on these units that they should not be used on gas dryers. Gas dryers really need to be vented outdoors because, unlike electric dryers, there's combustion and that results in fumes. The other vent shown with this one... Dundas Jafine TDIDVKZW ProFlex Indoor Dryer Vent Kit... states in the description \"Not be used with gas clothes dryers\". I would not do it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would this pick up pine needles on a lawn?\n Answer:","completion":" Possibly. It would depend on the condition of your lawn. It is a powerful machine.If they are long needles you would definitely be better off raking. If they are the short, stabbing variety it might be worth a try. If you have a regular shop vac I would recommend you try it first. It will definitely NOT be equivalent to an upright indoor vacuum on carpet. It just won't be that easy. You need a level surface. If your lawn is really thick it \"could\" help. If the lawn is sparse you would probably hurt the grass.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Should this filter be replaced every year? If not, how do you clean it?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Marlene, First I should point out this product is not really a filter. It's a wick that absorbs and holds moisture so the blower fan can push air through it and drive the water into the surrounding environment. How often it needs replacing depends upon how often the humidifier cycles and on the mineral content of your water. If you run your humidifier a lot and you are not using filtered water, then these wicks typically need replacing about every three months (at least). I use filtered water in my humidifier to reduce the mineral content but I still have to replace the wick every 5-6 months. It's pretty simple to determine when your wick is clogged with minerals because the humidifier will basically run non-stop as there will be no moisture in the wick therefore no moisture going into the air. These wicks are not really cleanable because they are too fragile. Once they get clogged with minerals (i.e. \"lime\") they need to be disposed of and replaced.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I want to mount it to the wall with no cabinet above it using L brackets. Would this be ok to do?\n Answer:","completion":" If only L brackets are used in the back, I'd say no. There's extra holes in the top and rear so at minimum, I'd secure the rear to wall studs with extra screws. The weight is more center\/front and my concern is over time it would droop forward. It's designed to mount under a cabinet. If there is something to mount the sides to it would work better.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what type of cover is over the light bulb ?\n Answer:","completion":" It's just a plastic diffuser. It locks into a couple of slots in the hood. You squeeze the two sides together to release tabs on the sides of the diffuser from the slots in the hood. Takes a standard base, 60watt or small CFL bulb.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the CFM or power?\n Answer:","completion":" The Broan 4130 is not rated for CFM because it is a non ducted hood. Probably about 100-150 cfm fan, 2850 rpm. You don't want too much air blowing back in your face anyway. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it come with a power cord\/\n Answer:","completion":" No. Unfortunately you would have to purchase the cord at a home depo or any hardware store for about $5.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have no above cabinet......can I install on wall???\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't. There are 4 holes on the back, but the metal of the hood isn't very thick and wouldn't support much weight. A cheap solution would be to get piece of shelving the size of the hood with two brackets mounted to the wall upside down and mount the hood to the bottom of the shelf. This will give you some extra storage space as well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it get rid of kitchen smoke...that's what I need. My kitchen doesn't have an exhaust fan and every time I cook it smokes up the house.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does. I don't have an exhaust fan either, so this takes care of it. Diana D.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How long have you had your hoses and have you experienced any leaks or leaking fittings?\n Answer:","completion":" I've had my hoses for a few months, and I have not had any leaking, at all. The fittings have a very good rubber washer, which will hold up for years to come. These hoses have a 5 year warranty, but will last for a lot more than that. Braided hoses are the best for any kind of plumbing, as they are not prone to bursting, like none braided hoses are. Fluidmaster is the best brand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this ship with a quantity of two hoses for the current listed price?\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: my icemaker now makes chuncks of ice then stops but a lot of my freezer is coated with ice. is this from the icemaker or the water valve?\n Answer:","completion":" The water valve is controlled by the ice maker. Mine stuck on over night and caused a flood. There is about a 7 second \"fill\" as the ice maker cycles. You may want to check to see if it cycles, does it get all the ice out before filling again.

The wiring harness is the only part that does not come with the ice maker. The connection from the old one fit perfect. I researched your model #MTB2156DEW and it looks exactly like model#D7824706Q. I will say that it is compatible.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I replaced my icemaker, and the valve on the back, but i still fills bucket up with mostly water\n Answer:","completion":" Check the temperature of the freezer. It needs to be well below freezing before the ice maker will work. Around 0 to 10 degrees F.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 70966 not like picture The part number of this product says \"70966\" which is a removeable sound baffle (much like InSinkErator RSB-OO Removable Sound Baffle, Black). The picture shown is not the 70966 sound baffle. Is it the product a sound baffle or...\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure if my answer will help but here it is. You do not have to remove the disposal to replace with this part. It acts as a splash guard and a sound baffle also. Hope this helps. You are right it doesn't quite look like the pic either it has a groove running around the side to \"snap\" into place in the drain. Good luck\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you please tell me the diameter of this? It says 1\" which is obviously wrong!!\n Answer:","completion":" I could not use this one , it was to large, I think 4.50 inches, so it went in the trash.. I have part number 39-9057 3.1 x3.1 x .05 and it fits perfect.. all others were to large, I hope the helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this fit insinkerator evolution essential?\n Answer:","completion":" No I bought this as a suppressor of noise, and it came to me as a insinkerator gasket.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: does it fit kitchen aid disposals?\n Answer:","completion":" It does not fit too good\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions please, seemed to have problems finding one which fits our drain..\n Answer:","completion":" It is 3 1\/4 inch diameter and we have a sink-erator disposal and it snapped right in. Also, what is amazing, the sound that we used to hear from the disposal prior to installing the new snap in have been eliminated. It is almost silent now, highly recommend this product....\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It's not clear if this product includes a blower or not. Does it come with a blower or do I have to purchase that separately?\n Answer:","completion":" This is just the range hood (despite the product description). You'll need to purchase the blower separately. We bought the Broan HLB11 1100 CFM In-line Blower and love it. We used a HVAC installer to mount the blower in our crawl space under the house.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, Time of Warranty and if have all to necesary for instalation? Thanks you\n Answer:","completion":" No I need the blower\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how high does the hood raise?\n Answer:","completion":" 7inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this down draft automatic go up and down by a button?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This downdraft would be a replacement for me and for a cut out of 28 1\/4 inch, would this work for me and what is the amperage on this downdraft?\n Answer:","completion":" The cutout is about 27\". The decorative top trim is 30\" so if you could neatly fill in the gaps so the unit would rest on them, the only time you would see the \"Dutchman\" is when the blower is up and on.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can door hinges be reversed to allow opening of door to left? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, this model does have reversible doors so that you can have the swing to the left or right side of the unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this freezer automatically defrost?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know---we just had huge amounts of ice form in back and called the service dept that wants to charge us a lot of $$ to come and look at it. $89 just to come out and then minimum of $100 to start repair. Our unit is only 1.3 years old.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it reliable or does it break down\n Answer:","completion":" It no longer 'breaks down' because we found the fault. This model anyway, was NOT tested for areas with slightly above average humidity. The air circulation vents in freezer section clog up with ice, even though the fan is running, and the de-ice element, deep inside the freezer is working! Every 2 weeks and I have to do a manual defrost of the freezer, otherwise, if I get a large buildup of ice in that area, the sensor will again fail. I won't buy any more LG product based on this. (We also have a large flat screen LG TV, now out of guarantee, with failures in responding to remote, and the screen displaying vertical lines). We have read that LG make inferior product, that their concept is that it's cheaper to do this due to their massive sales, so they can absornb the repairs. Heck, when out of guarantee it'll cost you an arm and a leg anyway. The old Hitachi we chucked out, too small, never missed a beeat in 2 decades.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Powering: 110 or 220 V \/ 50 or 60 Hz?\n Answer:","completion":" 110 not sure if 50 or 60\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how much energy does it use\n Answer:","completion":" I have absolutely no idea how I would be able to know this. I can't imagine it is very much, being new and smaller.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this appliance quiet enough to keep in the house as a spare?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It's small and sounds like a regular refrigerator, not super quiet like a SubZero but not at all loud. I use mine as an only refrigerator (one person household). My dog did was afraid of the old one, she went through about 4 screens last summer.... She's OK with this one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hard to tell from picture..does it have 2 doors? Almost looks like is only one door that covers both compartments?\n Answer:","completion":" It has two doors, top is the refrigerator and the bottom is the freezer. I use this as a spare refrigerator and have it in my garage. I love it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The description says ice maker included. Is this correct?\n Answer:","completion":" Oh gosh - I do not think so! I will have my manager check today and let you know!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you know what is the clearance between this unit and the cabinets (top and sides)? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Dunno. Is it a fridge? If so buy it at your risk.. . My LG big expensive double door.. has a major design flaw. The cold air recirculation vents in the deep freeze are too small, so that it rapidly, in a couple of weeks, ices up. The auto-defroster cannot handle it. The circulation fan starts clunking as it hits the ice buildup behind the deepfreezer. . I have to do a manual defrost. I have cut the holess much bigger and it's better, but still needs a manual defrost. This last time I made the holes enormous, so lets see if that helps. If I just left it alone, and not manual defrosted, the deice sensor burns out and and that costs $$$. It has already burnt out 2, thats why I have to fiddle with it. Maybe LG just churn out new product and hope for the best, with little or no testing. If somebody gave me an LG fridge as a present, I would refuse it!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this refrigerator come in stainless steel\n Answer:","completion":" It no longer does.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions of this dispenser? I don't see that anywhere. Thanks, Barb\n Answer:","completion":" The approximate dimensions are 15 1\/2\" long, about 10\" tall and about 5\"wide. I find it fits very nicely in the fridge and doesn't take up that much space. I love this dispenser :). Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this product certified to remove lead, I've seen it multiple areas on your website where it says it is, and isn't?\n Answer:","completion":" It is not certified to reduce lead. You can look it up on NSF.org (http:\/\/info.nsf.org\/Certified\/dwtu\/listings.asp?CompanyName=kaz&submit1=Search+by+Manufacturer&Program=DWTU). No pour-through model is certified for lead reduction. This is false advertising (a few faucet models can do it but it has nothing to do with this particular model).

{"prompt":"Question: Is this dispenser BPA free?\n Answer:","completion":" According to the information on their website, yes, it is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the lid fit and stay on this if you leave out the filter and top water reservoir so this can be used as a tea dispenser?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it will stay on. But it's not friction style and is simply a loose cover similar to a cooking pan and lid\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this to filter out the sulfur in their water? We have well water with a strong sulfur smell and taste\n Answer:","completion":" It's the best I have found for well water. I found the faucet attachments do not do the trick and the smaller pitchers' carbon is not strong enough.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you know when to change the filter?\n Answer:","completion":" A calendar sticker comes with the dispenser, along with a marker that estimates the date to change (about 3 months after installation). But I guess it also depends on how unclean the water is. I wouldn't recommend using for longer than they recommend because seeing the buildup of sediments in the filter is scary!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is weight of the filled pitcher? is it difficult to lift? Arthritis in thumbs and difficulty holding onto heavy items. Cannot see the handle.\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure of the weight...maybe 4-6 lbs. But at the front and back of the pitcher, the \"cover\" extends about 3 inches, so there's more than enough room to comfortably hold on and move it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I fill this up all the way to the top, or do I have to stop at the blue segment?\n Answer:","completion":" I fill mine up, let it filter to the bottom and then top it off until totally full to the line at the lid. NO PROBLEM\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: When I changed battery in my unit. It reads 15% RH and never changes from that reading. Is there a reset button . I changed batterys twice now to s\n Answer:","completion":" I have never encountered this problem, however a few times I had rub the positive end on my shirt sleeve and then the display appeared. My units do not have a reset button\n"}

Search Amazon for \"PAR20 LED bulb\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does a filter come with hood\n Answer:","completion":" The metal screen grease filters are included, but the charcoal snap-in filters must be ordered separately from Amazon. They fit perfectly and cost around $15 for a pair.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Ducted installation but lots of of air coming out of the slots on top. IS it normal?\n Answer:","completion":" No. The installation instructions show how to set the hood damper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with a cord-and-plug assembly, or do I have to hard wire it in?\n Answer:","completion":" Hard wire, I believe. Test before you install to make sure this works. Mine was damaged.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the size of the duct vent\n Answer:","completion":" This range hood has three knock-outs- a 3-1\/4\"x10\" rectangular on the back, another 3-1\/4\"x10\" rectangular on top, or a 7\" round on top. It comes with the rectangular damper (to keep cold air from coming into the kitchen from outside), but does not come with a damper if you choose to connect via the 7\" round pipe.

{"prompt":"Question: Price is pretty cheap. Is it strong?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased this 1-1\/2 years ago, it was easy to install. Unit is built very good, heavy material, cleans easy, is very quiet on low and fairly quiet on hi but it moves a lot of air. Very happy with purchase. It is a 2 year old model but I prefered this to the new model when I bought it and it was 1\/2 off the new model year. . James K\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How well does the ductless install work to remove cooking odors?\n Answer:","completion":" The vent has two speeds, the lower speed does remove air, however, if you are doing some serious cooking the second speed would be required. That speed seems to work fine.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this rangehood ductless\n Answer:","completion":" It can be either\/or. The instructions show you both ways.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size halogen bulbs dose it take and which filters do I nee d to purchase?\n Answer:","completion":" We are using conventional mini floodlight bulbs now. I plan to install LED bulbs next time around. The bulb socket is conventional so any non CFL would work. The dimmer function, 2 position, works fine with the mini floods.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this unit have the very large fan blade in it ? over 10\" in diameter ?\n Answer:","completion":" yes the fan is ten inches or more.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Must you use halogen bulbs?\n Answer:","completion":" yes and are expensive\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: does this washer have a spin cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not have a spin cycle. What we used to do was to let the wash water drain of course, then run water in it and re-run the wash cycle while it was slowing draining the water out, that way they clothes were getting rinsed and then we just let all the final rinse water drain out and with the drain open, we ran it through another washing cycle to sling most of the water out. Worked pretty well. It does a GREAT job on washing clothes but to answer you question, NO, it does not have a spin cycle. We would then squeeze the water out by hand which was not very had to do. I have this one for sale now myself. Would take 65 for it and ship it free. donkennedy97@ yahoo. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this hook up through a hose to a water faucet?\n Answer:","completion":" No. You have to add water yourself, either with shower hose or bucket. It's not that hard, though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: u dont got to hook it up to the sink do u for the water to go in and does it drain all the water out of clothes like a reg washer does\n Answer:","completion":" you cant hook it up to the sink\/ has to be filled manually by hand. IT DOESNT HAVE A SPIN CYCLE SO NO IT DOESNT DRAIN THE WATER OUT OF THE CLOTHES AT ALL.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this machine have a limit of how hot the water can be? (The Basecamp washer instructions say the water used should not exceed 113 F.) Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" it is manual fill... as in you fill it with water, so its as hot or cold as you chose. I use mine in the shower and fill it with a shower hose. It is also manual drain, which is why I use it in the shower, the hose on the back needs to be up when in use and down to drain, it is a very low draining hose, so you need either a floor drain or use in shower as i do. It is very light weight, so I simply put it in the shower when I need to wash laundry and store it in the closet when not in use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has the timer went out? and how do you fix the timer\n Answer:","completion":" I mostly use it for making bubble hash, but i have used it to wash an outfit or two a few times. As long as you follow the directions and dont overload the washer it should run great. I have 300+ hours on it myself and i'v loned it out several times. Still works awesome.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many cloths can it contain?\n Answer:","completion":" Less than a traditional washer, more than some of the smallest compact models. While everybody's idea of a load is somewhat different, and working with the pounds specified by manufacturers is not always intuitively easy, I'd say that it would be about a half load or a bit less than a normal moderately sized load for a traditional model. Before you purchase this model, however, you should read my other comments here, along with some of the other notes. This washer is a rugged little machine, which is made in America to serve principally in janitorial operations as a mop head and rag washer for a janitor's closet. As such, it can be a very cheap and rugged alternative for home use, but IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC WASHER, in the modern sense. It is much more akin to antique washers, as it is really just a pail with a timer controlled agitator and a drain hose. That's it. You have to fill it with water, drain it, fill it again to rinse, drain it, maybe rinse again, and all by hand, and then wring out your clothes and dry them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many gallons of water will this hold?\n Answer:","completion":" It takes 10 gallons to reach the minimum fill line before I added any laundry items. However, when I added 4 pairs of fleece pants the water registered at the maximum fill line. For me then, with my water tank on my boat, I have to remember that a single load of laundry using 3 fills to the minimum will use 30 gallons of precious water tank water. First fill is with laundry detergent; second fill I add 1 cup vinegar to assist the rinse out of detergent; and the final fill is to rinse out all vinegar\/ soap residue. This vinegar technique does cut down on the lint retention on clothing. There is nothing else to capture lint. I would like to know what others do about laundry lint. I do wash dark clothes separately. The washer will take more than 4 pairs of fleece, I just filled the washer with water before adding clothes to see what amount of gallons I could use to the minimum fill line. I like my washer. It sure beats loading a harbor cart and walking half a mile to the nearest laundromat. I also use a spin-dry extractor which allows clothes on plastic hangers to hang dry overnight.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How fast is the agitation? I want it to be very delicate for my valuable clothes and I'm worried it will be to rough...\n Answer:","completion":" The agitation is pretty powerful. It's sort of a whirlpool action. You can always set the timer for a short amount of time and monitor your clothes (or put them in a garment bag).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you calibrate it\n Answer:","completion":" It's called \"The Salt Test\". You take about a table spoon of salt in a little cup or something of that nature, and add a few drops of water to it. Place the salt and hygrometer in a liplock bag for 6-12 hours and it should read 75 %, if not, turn the little screw type thing in the back.........but be careful, my last one broke on first adjustment.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this model be ideal for a gun safe?\n Answer:","completion":" No, I tried to dial it in and it broke on the first twist. I didn't try to get my money back since it was so cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. Check out the ones they sell at cigar shops then come back to Amazon and spend a few more bucks for something more dependable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the hygrometer metal and glass, or plastic?\n Answer:","completion":" metal and glass\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the diameter? 2.25 or 1.8 or 1-3\/4\n Answer:","completion":" 2\" across dial including bezel. 1\"3\/4 across back. 5\/8\" deep.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why is there a rubber ring around the hygrometer?\n Answer:","completion":" Seems like you would need to take it off, or remove the magnet. Otherwise, how will the air circulate into the unit where the sensor is?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'd like to use this hygrometer to keep track of the humidity in my acoustic guitar's case. Do you think it would work well for this purpose?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it works great! In fact, I replaced my fancy (expensive) digital hygrometer with this little dial hygrometer. I highly recommend it for the guitar case. My Larrivee acoustic keeps a steady '65' index, with Large DampIt in sound hole + extra sponge under the neck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this just for small spaces (like a cigar humidor or guitar case) or can one use this for small rooms (12 x 15, for instance)?\n Answer:","completion":" It could be used in a room.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the display time out or does it continuously display temp and humidity without pushing any buttons? I want to use in jars but don't want to open\n Answer:","completion":" The temp and humidity display is continuous.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The picture shows a box that reads \" CaIiber IV\" but the post says it's a \"III\"; please explain this discrepancy. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" The company these come from (http:\/\/www.cigaroasis.com\/) sold\/sell both the III and the newer IV which the website states of the IV \"The same great features as the Caliber III, but now with the ability to adjust Calibration. In response to our customers' requests, we have responded with this high end feature.\" It is also stated that the \"CALIBER III HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED NOW SHIPPING CALIBER IV HYGROMETER W\/CALIBRATION ADJUSTMENT\" at the Amazon listing: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/DISCONTINUED-SHIPPING-HYGROMETER-CALIBRATION-ADJUSTMENT\/dp\/B00AA1B7X8\/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1390082966&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=caliber+hygrometer. I would have to concur since the III is no longer listed on their website. From experience I can tell you that they are a good company to deal with since I had one of my IIIs take a dive and they replaced it with no questions asked. Enjoy!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Anyways: what kind of technology is used for the sensor? How many years is it stable for???\n Answer:","completion":" Maybe that's a question for the manufacturers. Western humidor has a call line for questions at 1-877-627-4798. I own 4 of the caliber III. For over a year now, it's been running steady and accurate. Reacts almost immediate to humidity changes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought this item from you and it is not even close to accurate, How do I calibrate it? Or should I just return it.\n Answer:","completion":" I have a caliber IV hygrometer for a humidor which performs very well. To calibrate mine I followed the instructions and removed the activator tab.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the humidity range?\n Answer:","completion":" 20% to 99%\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 1. What are those two unlabeled buttons of the front for? 2. How easy is it to change battery?\n Answer:","completion":" 2. It's easy to take the battery out and replace it, but there is no stop, so the battery can fall out when the entire battery holder comes out (if you're not careful). This happened to me and the battery fell on the floor. Now I don't see in what orientation the battery should be when a new one is put in (positive up or down).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do they come in different sizes\n Answer:","completion":" 18 inch long cuff fits all, stretchable\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would you recommend these for bathing a cat? (Yes, I understand that bathing a cat may not be advisable, but that decision has been made so I'm looking for something to protect my arms.)\n Answer:","completion":" NO it's a waste of money , bought these for gardening but they slip down and get caught on everything.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: comfortable to wear all day?\n Answer:","completion":" Here, in the Florida panhandle with the heat and humidity outdoors, they get sweaty and a little uncomfortable after a while, and I pull them off, but by then, I am generally done for the day anyway.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do they come in other colors?\n Answer:","completion":" No Kevlar is only made in Yellow. There are other materials available. Dyneema for instance is white.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Duhhh... when it says \"6 pack\" is it referring to \"6 sleeves\" (3 pair) or 12 sleeves \"6 pairs of sleeves?\"\n Answer:","completion":" 6 Each as in 3 Pairs\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will these sleeves protect against limited\/short contact time with a hot exhaust manifold under 200 degrees.\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure but racks and ovens running at tips greater than 200 degrees. Contact for her have been accidental brushes. Hope that helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are they machine washable and reusable?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes the are, but they don't stay up well before or after washing.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: My Kitchen Aid side by side is model #KSRV22FVBTOO. It is a type 22 MSSA. Will this Whirlpool 4396508 work for me?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Larry, I think your model # is the push button water filter. Is there a button on the bottom that you have to push to eject?

{"prompt":"Question: My current filter is 4396508, it does not have a letter P after it. Are they the same filter?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not 100% sure, but it probably is the same filter.

{"prompt":"Question: why is it cheaper to buy two one packs than one two pack?\n Answer:","completion":" It probably doesn't have anything to do with the product itself. I believe Amazon prices tend to fluctuate day to day, depending on inventory levels. My guess is there are just more of the 1-packs in stock right now, so the prices are set to incentivize customers to purchase that pack size instead of the 2-pack.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: are any of these treatment products suitable for built in (the heating system) humidifiers?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't say about using it in your home heating humidifier, but I wouldn't use it in your system.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter work with a Pro Care PCCM-832N cool mist humidifier?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, that is the model I use it in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter work with the Graco 1.5 gallon humidifier?\n Answer:","completion":" NO - it will not work with any humidifier. It is made of very flimsy materials, it does not absorb any water at all, there is no wafer like absorption area like the original filters that come with your machine. Do not fall for these as I did thinking any replacement filter would work. I ordered a set of two. Sealed together by each other in plastic wrap -- they are over one inch different in size even one from the other. These are truly worthless.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the Broan F403023 has a round hole on the tope which can attach a duct to the wall outlet&#xFF1F;\n Answer:","completion":" It has a large knockout for an oval duct; I had to use tin-snips to cut out a round hole to go straight up.

{"prompt":"Question: Is the unit exactly 30\" wide? The space above the stove measures 29.875\" inches (same as the space the stove fits in).\n Answer:","completion":" I measure 29 and 7\/8ths to 29 15\/16th. We're in the range that the accuracy or consistency of tape measures is critical variable. If you took a standard 30\" hood out you should be just fine. Even so nearly everything should fit in standard openings. With these sizes you're talking about, a lot depends on the \"squareness\" of the hole because you don't have a lot of clearance to work with. I'd say to go ahead and order--the odds are way in your favor--and you can always return it--just fit it in before doing all the other installation things. Glad to help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the power cord wire come with it?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Range hoods are almost always hard wired and therefore do not come with a power cord. If you are replacing an existing range hood the wire should already be there.

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be cut....we have an outlet that needs tobe cut out..stainless is harder then sheet metal?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I cut it by first drilling a hole and then used a jigsaw with metal cutting blade. Protect the surface of the metal, maybe some painters tape or something like that as I almost ruined my by the vibration scratches from the jigsaw. If you do it right the cover plate will hide the cut edges.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I've seen that several people have mentioned the backsplash is smaller than 30 inches wide. Has that problem been addressed recently?\n Answer:","completion":" Just re-measured mine. 29 7\/8\" Didn't know this was an issue. I used two of these and centered them on the stove. You have burners on the edges of the stove, and a splash guard that ends at the edge of the stove won't give you full coverage for splatters. JMO.

{"prompt":"Question: proper re-placement of filter and fill up?\n Answer:","completion":" Very simple. Remove the used filter by sliding it off and slip the new one on. If I am going to use the humidifier immediately, I usually soak the new filter in water before putting it on. That way, the humidifier is ready to go. Be sure to fill the water reservoir with fresh clean water. If your water is particularly hard, you might want to add a softening solution, such as \"Golden Solution Water treatment\". This is available at Amazon.com.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the difference between honewell HC14 and HC14N filter?\n Answer:","completion":" They are just about the same. The only difference I have found is the 14N is what is called an air wash filter because the blue is an extra layer of filtration for air born particles. As for humidifying the air they both work the same.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does the filter in the photo look twice the height?\n Answer:","completion":" It doesn't look like that \"in real life\". Much more sqatty, looks about as wide as it is tall, once you unfold it out of the box. I use it in my HCM-6000 series humidifier. Also fits HCM3500 and HM3600 series.

I have been buying new filters every week!

{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter fit the 6011G model?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes the HC-14N (Filter E) is supposed to fit 6000 series, my humidifier is HCM 6009 fits perfect. I have to also use ProTec PC-1 Humidifier Tank Cleaning Cartridges to keep down the mold\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Filter in our Honeywell HCM 6009 not same size as the one listed as replacement..it came in humidifier ours is smaller????\n Answer:","completion":" This is what I have been using since 2012.....don't know how yours could be smaller???\n"}

Otherwise it is 8 x 3 x 14 inches. Remember you have to flip them everytime you replenish the water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the best way to clean these filters?\n Answer:","completion":" These are disposable filters, you have to keep flipping them over each time you fill your tank to make them last longer.

{"prompt":"Question: Smell\n Answer:","completion":" I only had one issue with smell, but I use a antibacterial additive to prevent the problem. Now I don't get a smell even when the filter is ready to be replaced.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why does it just stop even when water tank is full\n Answer:","completion":" The unit automatically shuts off when it reaches the desired humidity level - turn the right knob clockwise for more humidity. If this does not work remove and replace the front half of the unit - the electrical connections are sometimes finicky. If this does not work - does your unit need to be cleaned?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this louder\/quiter than the HWM450? Does it need to be cleaned more often?\n Answer:","completion":" Sounds the same. From my experience, the flat \"hot plate\" with filter requires a bit less cleaning than the \"metal mound-style burner.\" Use of filter is req'd however for the flat plate heater.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why honeywell quicksteam humidifier leaks\n Answer:","completion":" I bought one of these about a month ago, and this things never leaks. I don't even see where it could leak. If yours is leaking, it could be that there is a faulty part that you should replace, or maybe you have a piece out of place from when you cleaned it last. If it's very old, maybe the seal around the heating element is failing. But other than that, all the water is held in a solid plastic housing that couldn't leak unless it was cracked.

Great design.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Some of the other filters are made in China. Anyone know where the Purenex filters are made? Tks.\n Answer:","completion":" I checked the labels on the packaging and there is nothing to indicate the point of origin. Legally, that means it must be made in the USA as they are required to clearly identify where they are from if not from USA. I also checked the purenex website and they indicate that their water products are assembled in the usa. That could mean that components are made elsewhere and assembled here, but again, they are SUPPOSED to state if they are assembled in USA using imported parts. I've been using these for over a year and they appear to work great. Only problem I have is that we have a LOT of particulate matter in our water and being 1 micron filters, they do plug up in 1 to 2 months. That is to be expected and not a fault of the filters.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: FXUSC\n Answer:","completion":" Actually Purenex is too good. I have cloudy well water and the Purenex one micron does a great job cleaning up The sendiment. My problem is that I have to change the filter at least once a month. It is a hassle but at least my water is clean.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: if the filter mwf is bad the refrigirator dont give me water on the door\n Answer:","completion":" usually. But you could also have a frozen water line in the door just behind the dispenser. Google your refrig on the web for \"no water in dispenser\" for answers on fixing that. I had a frozen water line and so changing my filter didn't do anything. Before you buy a new filter, try the \"by pass\" that came with your refrig when you first bought it. If the by pass allows the water to flow then, your filter is plugged up.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Water Pressure: Does anyone know if this filter is related to low flow?\n Answer:","completion":" i had the same problem with mine. about 6-7 months later the water delivery started to drop. i changed the filter but it did not increase. my next conclusion was a blockage of some sort. i happen to have a oil changer for my cars that works on suction. i pulled the fridge out shut off water supply removed the filter and put in the plug that came with the fridge. then i hooked up the inlet to the fridge to the oil changer. pumped it up and the pressed the water dispenser bar in front of the fridge. it sucked out some dirt and some kind of thick little globs of who knows what. put it all back together and the water flowed like it was day one. here it is 8 months later and i see i need to blow it out again. also fyi, you do not have to use the ge filters. a company called swift green filters makes one that fits. model sgf-g9 i found it for about 18.00 it is rated the same as the ge but for less money. as for the oil changer it is a mightyvac mv7400. it was about 50.00 but worth it because we have 3 cars and at 30.00 a pop for an oil change it was worth buying and it doubles for the suction for the fridge. hope this helps you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I currently have a GWF flter in my fridge. I just ordered this and it says MWF on it. Does it fit my GWF fridge?\n Answer:","completion":" The MWF is a new slimmer design It replaces GE water filter part numbers GWF, GWFA, GWF01, GWF06, MWFA, and Hotpoint HWF, HWFA .

Based on average use. A household with 4 kids differs from a household of 2 mature adults. My monogram is 14 years old. perfect so far.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does low ice production mean that it is time to change the filter?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't had that issue but I think I still can help. Your fridge should have an indicator when the filter needs to be changed, BUT if it doesn't, then on average, every 3 to 4 months is what I use for a guide. However, I HAVE discovered that there are times when the water speed is very slow, & not strong, however even though the indicator isn't showing the need for a change, if I change the filter the flow is perfect again. So, I reckon you should try changing it if it's been about 3 - 4 mos. If that doesn't help the ice poduction for you, I'd check with the manufacturer. Guess they just don't make 'em like they used to. Hope that helped you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many gallons does it filter?\n Answer:","completion":" According to the manufacturer it will filter approximately 300 gallons of water or 6 months. In my experience the water flow starts to slow down when the filter needs replacing. Another way to ensure that you replace it at the right time is to write the date of instillation on the filter with a black marker.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you have to prime the filter before installing it ?\n Answer:","completion":" The filter does NOT have to be primed. However, after it is installed, you must run at least a gallon of water through it. Be careful while running that gallon as the high water pressure may cause it to splash for a few seconds.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter remove Fluoride from the water?\n Answer:","completion":" According to Manufacturer, this does not remove fluoride from water.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: do you need to turn off the water before replacing the filter?\n Answer:","completion":" No. You do not. It will dribble a tad but that's it. Run a gallon of water through it after changing it and you're done.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with the case?\n Answer:","completion":" It's more of a over. I would recommend to actually purchase it through the company and get a warranty if possible. It's known to malfunction. Hope that helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How long does the battery last if left on the thermo-hygrometer setting constantly?\n Answer:","completion":" Well, when I first bought mine, I forgot to turn it off about 2days and it drained my batt. The metronome acted funny when there is not enough juice power. I guess that because the battery included with purchased maybe to its dued date. With new battery, I have been more careful to turn it off when not use it. Still last for several months. The product is great. Recommended to friends & teachers. They all love it. :)\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this product to prevent cold air from leaking in from a through the wall bathroom exhaust fan. We live in Southern California.\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure if a bath exhaust fan would have enough pressure to open the vent. The vent uses a inverted plastic 'cup' riding in the center of the assembly to seal the vent when not in use. The 'cup' may weigh a little to much to open with a fan, but works great with a dryer. You might try contacting the manufacturer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: has anyone installed it specifically to prevent mice from coming into dryer vent? if so did it work for that? thank you,\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know about \"specifically\" but I don't see how mice could get into the vent when the dryer is off. When the dryer is running there is a \"gap\" but there's also the \"wind\" coming thru the vent so I wouldn't think mice would climb into the hot wind.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with attached piping to fit into existing piping?\n Answer:","completion":" No it doesn't. We did not have any pipe as this was new construction, it ran $4 at the hardware store. I have had these before and the old pipe worked on this.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be used with bathroom exhaust fan\n Answer:","completion":" Yes we have used ours for about 6 months and it works fine.

{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know if this product can be used if you have an aerobic septic system or will it harm the microbes?\n Answer:","completion":" I was sold on the feature that this Insinkerator product will enhance the microbial activity in my septic. I had never used a garbage disposal before my kitchen remodel in mid 2014. I have not seen any diverse activity in my septic sas of now with the use of this product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone had an issue with leaking from the cartridge after it's been changed?\n Answer:","completion":" I have used this product for over 10 years. Once, and only once I did feel a drip while I installed the new cartridge. All I did was to press the button and push the bottle in again. Never a leak since. From my experience, if it leaks, it is the installer's fault ;-) Don't worry, just push the release button and push the bottle all the way in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My garbage disposal doesnt have a hole underneath to stick the jambuster into. so what now?\n Answer:","completion":" Well, make sure that there isn't a cap over a center hole on the bottom! Also, most will have a red button on the bottom that is a circuit breaker. Press that in a test run it. Assuming that doesn't work, kill the circuit to the disposer. Then use the oldest method in the books. Stick a broom handle down in side and lever it around and around, reversing direction. Use a flashlight to look inside for things like glass or flatware and carefully fish them out. Rinse only if the water is flowing through. Try and fire it up! If you hear nothing but a click, which can happen at the same moment as the switch clicks so it is easy to miss, the breaker may pop again. Try it all a few times before ordering a new one! Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have tried turning it back and forth but it won't budge...should I keep forcing it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work on a 555SS Insinkerator disposal that is jammed?\n Answer:","completion":" Insinkerator sells only one size JamBuster for all their models. It only took a couple of wiggles for me and was cheaper than a plumber visit of a replacement. I had a sawed-off piece of broom handle, just in case, to pry from the top. Be sure to turn off the power to the disposal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I can turn the insinkerator using this, but still stiff, even after turning it a dozen times. I still get hum -no spin- only when turn on. Next steps?\n Answer:","completion":" Work the wrench back and forth in both directions. If the wrench will not turn easily, it is OK to use some force. Continue working with the wrench until it turns freely in complete circles in both directions. Check the overload protector. The overload protector is located under the sink, on the bottom of the disposer, facing the floor. It is a small red button. If the overload protector has tripped, you will see the red button dropped down. Press the red button. With the disposer powered OFF, check inside the grinding chamber. Look down into the disposer using a flashlight. Do not place your hand into the disposer. If you see anything in the disposer, remove it using tongs or pliers.Turn on the water, then the disposer. The disposer should now run. If the problem is rust or mineral deposits stuck on the blades, you can try a chemical like CLR Calcium Lime Rust Remover. Use it to liquify the mineral deposits and free the blades so they will spin. If the disposer continues to jam, you may need to service or replace it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How does this muffle noise and prevent splash back with the large holes--you can see the bottom of the disposer thru the large center opening?\n Answer:","completion":" Michele, it really does, probably because of the way it makes fluid flow. Easy out for cleaning. Only complaint would be that waste needs help down thru as it gets caught on the flaps. But would buy again w\/o hesitation, as a quick, easy, inexpensive fix.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with my insinkerator compact-p-1 3\/4 hp\n Answer:","completion":" If you look at your insinkerator and it says badger then yes, other wise I'm not sure.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this filter work in place of the culligan IN-1 filter i have now?\n Answer:","completion":" I copied this from a web site (waterfilters.net)Culligan has discontinued the IN-1 filter and replaced the IN-1 filter with newer technology. The Culligan IC-EZ-3 inline filter system has replaced the Culligan IN-1 system. The Culligan IC-EZ-3 has different fittings and will completely replace the Culligan IN-1.

Does it fit up?\n Answer:","completion":" I attached one end of the Lambro flexible aluminum duct to the crimped end of a 5 in. x 60 in. 30-Gauge Galvanized Round Sheet Metal Pipe from Home Depot and the other end to Speedi-Collar SC-05D 5-Inch Diameter Take Off Start Collar with Damper from Amazon.com. No transition pipe was needed, I used 5-1\/2 inch metal worm drive clamps to fix the Lambro duct to the galvanized pipe and to the starter collar. Advice: do not try to stretch the Lambro flexible aluminum duct to more than 48 inches. If you overstretch it, it damages irreversibly\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this for house furnace (75,000 BTU) vent? This is the vent that goes all the way to the roof and out.\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure. I'm using it for a portable a\/c vent into ceiling space. It is kinda thin and doesn't seem durable enough for a furnace vent\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does this ducting stretch out to?\n Answer:","completion":" I would think it would stretch to the 5 feet advertised. When it arrived, it was probably less than 2.5 feet. I only needed about a foot and I only stretched the piece out a few inches. It is similar to the 4 inch aluminum dryer duct you can buy most anywhere. You need to be careful not to crush it but it worked fine for me. My application was to connect a kitchen vent to the solid pipe in the ceiling.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: voltage\n Answer:","completion":" Regular household outlet, 110 NOT 220. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it agitate like a regular washing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" It twists one direction, then the other direction, like clock wise and counter clockwise. You can set it for a few minutes or up to 15 minutes. The water does not drain, you fill it up and empty it out in a sink or whatever. Felting wool generates loose fibers that are detrimental to a regular washer. You can stop the a wonder a washer at any time. There is a gentle cycle and standard cycle.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this do a good job of felting hand knit woolen items, like slippers or mittens?\n Answer:","completion":" I've felted slippers in this several times. I added 3 tennis balls to the load to help with agitation. It took a few cycles to really felt the amount I wanted but it's so easy to check on. I have a front-load washer that is hard to stop in the middle of a cycle and I risk over-felting with that, so the Wonder Washer is great. It also keeps all of that yarn fuzz out of my regular washer. I take the water from my Wonder Washer and dump it outside so that the fuzz doesn't go down my drain either - the birds find it and line their nests with it!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: The manual for my model says 3 filters are needed: HAPF600, HAPF600D and B filter. Are those the three different filters?\n Answer:","completion":" The filter requirements is a bit confusing. Three HEPA filters and three carbon filters are required for the larger room model # HAP756-U which I recently purchased and currently using. (Two of both the HEPA and carbon filters are required for the smaller room unit HAP726) Three true HEPA filters were included with the my unit and already installed (there are no discernible marking on the installed filters I can detect indicating a filter model number). However, there were no carbon filters installed or included with my purchased unit but I did purchase a pack of 4 which I installed when I set up my unit. I purchased a package of 2 Holmes make HEPA replacement filters (HAPF600D - B Filters) at the same time. Had I researched this better, I would have purchased the same box of 2 filters, plus 1 lone filter (same model #) since the unit requires that all three filter be changed when the red light indicates the filters be replaced. I am not aware of any distinction between an HAPF600 and an HAPF600D filter and I couldn't find this out on the Holmes website, either. Perhaps (but not sure) the \"D\" version removes either different allergens or more allergens from the air. As far as the \"B\" designation, I believe this identifies these as HEPA filters versus the \"C\" designation applied to the carbon filters.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What about using it with the Best Air \"Water &amp; Scaling\" treatment to address both the scaling and bacteria issues?\n Answer:","completion":" I've used it for both in a wicking humidifier (as opposed to one using heat or sonic vibrations to atomize the water). We use the humidifier nearly continuously since both our heater and central air dry the house terribly. Note that the treatment prevents scaling by keeping the deposits soft so that you can wipe\/wash them away. It cannot keep the calcium from precipitating out of the water. Bacteria will build up over several months time if you don't change your filter, no matter what solution you use. The anti-bacterial formulas in all products like this one kill of most of the bacteria\/alge, but cannot be 100% effective. I change my wicking filter ever couple of months.

{"prompt":"Question: Why can't this be used in ultrasonic humidifiers?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. It's just too dangerous that's why. Ultrasonic and vaporizer type humidifiers expel the water + chemical solution throughout the room.

{"prompt":"Question: I understant the way it collects the lint, but what happens to the humidity? Will I end up with wet walls?\n Answer:","completion":" There's no way to trap the humidity. When necessary I open doors and windows to ventilate, but often in the winter when it's cold and dry the warm humid air is welcome in my apartment.

I do not see how this can be used for a portable air conditioner.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Has any one had problems with the \"easy mount\" on a SS sink? The cushion mount slipped out of the mount ring on the second day.Is vibration a problem?\n Answer:","completion":" See the youtube video called \"Waste King Garbage Disposal EZ mount system\" and\/or the video \"How to Easily Purchase & Install a \"Waste King\" Garbage Disposal from Amazon.com\". You need to fit the rubber ring properly. Put the hard, screw-on, silver ring on first. Then the black rubber ring.

I have now had to throw it away and I am using Amazon to read customer reviews before purchasing online. I liked this for the first 2 months; the sound was noticeable but sounded like 'white noise', which didn't bother me. I followed the regular cleaning suggested by the manufacturer and thought all was good... until I noticed orange\/pink mold forming in all the crevices I couldn't reach. I tried to take it apart (without disassembling the motor area, obviously) but there were still so many areas with the tint of color. I continued to use it and within about a week from this point, there was black mold spotted everywhere inside. I looked up how to clean it online and I came across the Amazon reviews. I noticed many people saying that this left a white film in the room and it finally clicked: Our wood furniture, baseboards and fan blades had been needing a lot of extra cleaning that I didn't think much about beforehand... but it's only in the room w\/ the humidifier! I'll second all of the reviews on here expressing their opinions about how bad the white film and mold is with this product.

But how to clean up the top side openings?\n Answer:","completion":" I own one and it is NOT difficult to clean. Initially I scrubbed the parts with ajax to get rid of the layer mold. It was difficult and took a lot of time to do... but later I realized if I soak the main three component parts in a bleach water mixture, there is NO SCRUBBING TO DO!

{"prompt":"Question: How do I measure ? I need one Large and 3 small... 10\" ~ 6\"\n Answer:","completion":" Soobie, The drip pans, at least for a GE range, are sized based on the diameter of the circular openings in the cooktop. My small element openings on the cooktop measure 6 7\/16\" in diameter--just less than 6 1\/2\". To simplify things the drip pan manufacturer calls the pan to fit this opening a 6\" pan. My large element opening measures 8 7\/16\"--just less than 8 1\/2\" in diameter. The manufacturer calls the pan to fit this opening an 8\" pan. I would remove your elements and old pans, and measure the diameter of the openings. If they are like mine, then 6\" and 8\" pans will fit. By the way, these pans are of excellent quality. Regards, Rod\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: As a DIY install, can the Evolution Compact 3\/4hp unit replace an Insinkerator 1\/3hp model w\/o modifications?\n Answer:","completion":" The first thing you should do is get the dimensions for each model and compare them. If they are close or identical in size it should be no problem. If they are of different dimensions or if you have installed a new sink where the drains are not in the same position (as I did in switching to an undermount granite sink), some minor reworking of the plumbing may be needed. Regardless, this should not be difficult. I picked up a garbage disposal install kit at Home Depot for about 15 bucks. It has a variety of PVC plumbing connections in various lengths and angles. You might have to jerry-rig some of the connections, but the kit comes with threaded connections and washers, so no PVC glue or primer is necessary. Just make sure you measure twice, cut once, and install the washers in the correct direction, and you should be able to make it work. I also found some excellent install videos on You-tube for my particular set up (double sink drains, with the disposal on the left side and the drain connection on the right). Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it need a threaded flange? I am considering getting a separate flange to math the finish of my sink. It fits units, 4-1\/2\" diameter, 1-5\/8\" depth\n Answer:","completion":" Dear Jojo, I am not sure as don't know the mount system of this flange you mentioned. The Insinkerator flange has two pieces and the bottom one, that goes under the counter, has adjusting screws so you can you can tighten both pieces against each other from both sides of the sink bottom. Please note the screws go only from one piece of the flange to the other not trespassing the sink bottom. The flange is for 4-1\/2 drain valve sinks and the attachment of the Insinkerator is a \"bayonet\" type. I am almost sure all Insinkerators use the same mount type. If this flange is made for American garbage disposers it will PROBABLY fit. But I would check the compatibility with the flange manufacturer. He is the one that can assure you a 100% on this. I hope I have helped. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: whats the weight???\n Answer:","completion":" Don't really know but it was lighter than the one I took out. I use a built up stack of small 2 x 4's to hold it up and lock it into the sink.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: While this product gets many 5* reviews - it's the those with the unit the longest that are giving 1*. Can someone who has had it awhile comment.\n Answer:","completion":" I had one from when I purchased my place and it started leaking from the bottom intermittently. Insinkerator was very helpful but noted that it was over 7 years old and out of warranty from the serial number I supplied. I purchased another as it is one of the quietest disposals I've encountered and figured it would be an easy replacement (and it was). Customer service also seemed top notch and actually called a couple times to help me with the old unit. Just another note as I look at the one star reviews, the basket on my original one did not rust nor did the impellers freeze into place. I've actually started disassembling the old one and don't see much of any rust. There is some light surface rust around the impellers on the old and even my new one but think this is what one reviewer referred to as 'cosmetic' rust as it's non-scaling.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: People have mentioned that water drains very slow with this disposal, will this be a big problem in a single bowl sink? (Have the Kolher Stages sink)\n Answer:","completion":" Its true the disposal drains slowly, I have a single bowl sink.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this use a wall mounted on off switch\n Answer:","completion":" You need to buy a hako clamp or a Romeo to box connector and wire to connect to the disposal ~$10. The wire can be plugged into a switchable outlet under the sink. Good luck. Total cost estimate ~$200. I Bit the bullet as it will be my last, coming upon 80 yrs young!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: After I installed the disposer, the sink does not drain unless I am actually running the disposer. Any ideas on what might be causing this?\n Answer:","completion":" I agree this is an issue. Sorry, I don't have the answer. Mine does drain but is much slower than when the disposer is running. It hasn't been enough to be an problem for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: needed SinkTop Switch?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you do!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How far from the top is the top of the drain output?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Sarah. It is 6 inches from te top of the disposer (the one in contact with the bottom surface of the sink) to the center of the circle that is the drain output. Please see image with measures here: http:\/\/images.insinkerator.com\/pdf\/evocompact_specs.pdf . Now, beware that because of the anti-noise external cover the space left to the wall inlet is a little bit reduced. I hope that helps. Good luck with your decision.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the unit that operates with a wall switch? I don't want the one that uses the switch in the drain plug.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it's hardwired from the disposal and plugs into receptacle under the sink which is wired to the wall switch to turn the unit on and off. The wiring and electrical connector do not come with the unit and have to be purchased separately.\n"}

Is there a warranty??\n Answer:","completion":" I checked the document inside the case (I do not have the carton for reference) and agree that it indicates a 90 Day Warranty ONLY. My suggestion would be to pose that question directly to Wall Lenk since they have provided significantly varying information concerning their product. I'm not sure what the 5 year warranty stipulates, but I'm guessing it is very limited and probably not worth much. However, having published that information electronically, it could certainly be construed that their advertising supercedes the packaging and the internal paperwork.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size are the letters? What size is the head (total)?\n Answer:","completion":" The head is about 2 3\/4\" across, letter size in font sizes is about 28, quite readable, I like mine, any bigger and it would not work for me.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How does the shutoff kit work with a steam dryer connected to water supply?\n Answer:","completion":" This unit comes with the ability to connect more than one sensor. I put one sensor under my washer & purchased a second for under my dryer. I have a wye connector that splits the water going to the dryer and the washer. Should one of the sensors detect water, the solenoid valve will shut off. Once it shuts off, it will prevent water flow to either the washer or the dryer. A friend of mine did not have the shutoff kit & the hose going to his dryer developed a leak. Fortunately he was home & noticed the water flowing down the stairs to his basement. The sensors work as I tested each. I hope this answers your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Have recent purchasers received the older version (4x D batteries) or the newer version v4 (4x AA batteries)? Are there any other differences? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Apparently I have the \"old\" version (D cell batteries) but I've had the unit for several years and they've been no problem. I'd guess that they're using more solid state components and so are requiring less power -- thus the smaller batteries. In any case the system works, and works well. I wouldn't sweat the small stuff. PS - Also have the HWH system and have the same experience with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the valves need to be installed right side up to work? Do they still work if they are installed upside down? Has anyone installed them upside down?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, upside down or 90 degree will all work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: want to put one at the water main to house and put sensors under washer, water heater etc. but not sure the range of the sensors\n Answer:","completion":" The sensor wires are not that long, approximatly 6' Not sure you would be able to use this on a water main. This model only hooks up to a hoes bib.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: When water is detected, does this also shut off electrial power? If not, what happens to tub water if dain is clogged and machine is trying to empty\n Answer:","completion":" No, all this does is shut off incoming water from the faucet. If draining and the drain is clogged, there will be water on the floor. To faciliate this, another type of sensor will be needed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I know a sensor can be near a steam dryer to detect a leak-but how does the unit \"know\" that the dryer is getting water? Do u have to turn a switch?\n Answer:","completion":" Water will flow through the unit until the sensor detects a leak. There is an audible alarm then as well as a flashing light. There is no water flow then.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can these units be ordered without a sensor? I have extra sensors from previous project we can use.\n Answer:","completion":" I have no idea. You would have to contact Amazon or the manufacturer. My feeling is, why not get the sensors? They can't be that much more money and then you'll have extra parts just in case.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with the new v4 controller listed on the Floodstop website?\n Answer:","completion":" No. See the listing for FS 3\/4H-90 v4.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: thanks everyone! I was just asking because my hot water\/ cold water hoses are upside down - so I think still clock wise just turn right to turn off :)\n Answer:","completion":" I presume you are talking about the valves on the pipes coming out of the wall. If the hoses point up and the handles are on the bottom of the pipe, then, looking down at the fixture, you crank counterclockwise to shut the valve. It is an opposite action from your viewpoint. If you are still uncertain, then crank the valve handle to the limit of its travel in either direction. Then turn it the other way. If you suddenly hear water rushing through the pipe, then obviously it had been shut off and now the valve is open again.\n"}

I drilled a small hole in the floor of one if my closets to drop the probe thru and placed it where its easy to open the door and get a reading. Works great.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: This ad says the 44815's probe can \"extend on an 18-inch cable,\" how can I read humidity about 36\" away?\n Answer:","completion":" Not with this device\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this unit be suitable for monitoring conditions in an outside root cellar?\n Answer:","completion":" I would think that depends on the moisture level (humidity). It would certainly work but if the gauge itself is in the same high humidity environment as the probe, it might not have as long a life. I use mine at ambient room conditions with the probe in a lab oven at 113F and 70% humidity. Works great but my gauge display is always cool and dry.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: diameter\n Answer:","completion":" Approximately 3.5 inches (standard kitchen drain size).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this work on my insinkerator #777ss-1 with out taking it apart?\n Answer:","completion":" This merely sits on the drain opening; it has nothing to do with the inside. It's merely a flap to collect debris and prevent it from going into the InSinkErator. You can push anything through it, but it stops spoons, etc. from falling into the InSinErator.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this dishwasher safe?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, just put it on the top rack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this Collar Sink Baffle fit Model Pro 333 disposal?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know about your particular disposal, but I have an evolution septic assist disposal that I'm using this baffle with. Maybe you can cross reference the two but I thought all the insinkerator disposals used the same sink collars, so you should be fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: So, is the diameter 3 1\/8\" or 3 1\/2\"? I see both answers, which doesn't make sense since there's not a size choice option.\n Answer:","completion":" My InSinkErator opening is 3 1\/2\" and this fit it perfectly when inserted from the top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can install the disposal with only this, and not the built on splash guard. That would make cleaning a snap.\n Answer:","completion":" If I understand your question correctly, the built-in guard is part of the gasket between the sink collar and the disposal and must be used. If you do not install it you will have a leak. So both shields are used in conjunction with each other.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you think I can use this on a 15 year old insinkerator?\n Answer:","completion":" I'd say yes. Mine was at least that old and no problem. It actually seated better than the one that came with the disposal. They seem to be pretty standard.\n"}

This one LOOKS the same, but will it fit?\n Answer:","completion":" Not familiar with your model. The diameter on this splash guard is 3.1 inches and slides down the drain opening in the sink. No need to detach disposer. My suggestion will be to take out your old one and measure, if it is 3.1\" then theoretically this one should fit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" I measured the diameter and rim thickness of the Wast King 1025 Splash guard with a dial caliper and it has a diameter of 3.15 inches and a rim thickness of 0.52 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need something that will allow food to pass into the disposal but prevent kitchen utensils from doing so. Will this do the job?\n Answer:","completion":" No, this item consists of a splash guard, which is left in place to reduce splashing when using your disposal, and a drain stopper for preventing water from draining from your sink. The item you need is this: Danco 9D00010051 Universal Disposal Genie Amazon carries this now (when I bought mine, they didn't). If I'd bought this sooner, I'd have 8 salad forks instead of seven. You can use the disposal genie with or without the splash guard, I use it with it because the disposal is quieter with it in place. Read the reviews on the Disposal Genie and see if would work for you. I'm very happy with it. Hope this helps you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this sink stopper fit Waste King Legend 2600\n Answer:","completion":" I think so but am not sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit a 3 1\/4 opening? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" This should fit. The best I can tell it sit on top and you don't need to take the disposal out\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the splash guard 3\" in outside diameter?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is 3\" in outside diameter. It works great.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: This shows it will fit a Whirlaway 291 1\/2 hp disposal has anyone used it for a Whirlaway disposal?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, can't help you. But if it shows it will work for that then I would think you'd be safe.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it fit Waste King SS 2600?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. To be sure, the diameter of the top of the drain should be 3.1 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the length of this flex hose? I'm looking for something in the 5-10 foot range, but cannot find any specs here\n Answer:","completion":" the 24 stands for 24 inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this work for Rinnai RU98i? (requires 3\/4\" internal diameter hose)?\n Answer:","completion":" This hose is a true 3\/4\" ID hose.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the BTU range?\n Answer:","completion":" Cannot answer the BTU maximum, but have been using for one year with a 440,000 BTU natural gas pool heater with no problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The 3\/4 in fip and mip thread fittings supplied with flex hose will fit standard 3\/4 black pipe thread?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they most definitely will. One thing to be careful of is when tightening, keep an eye on the yellow hose to be sure it doesn't start twisting if you begin to tighten too much. Try not to allow this twist. Good luck with our project.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i can only get 20 lb tank is it possible to have the co2 tank on the outside? and if so where is a safe place to drill?\n Answer:","completion":" The unit comes with a 2.5lb tank. I bought a 20lb tank and got lucky when I drilled through the shell the first time. I drilled another hole for another add on and punctured the refrigerant lines. What did I learn from that? From the inside of the refrigerator cut the plastic shell with a box cutter. Use one where you can adjust the depth and only expose enough of the blade to cut the plastic. cut the hold large enough to expose the foam. Using a plastic spoon, stick, your fingers, just nothing sharp, scrape away the foam until you get to the metal outer shell. You may or many not run into cooling lines but if you do, you now have them exposed and you can drill from the INSIDE to run your CO2 lines. Learn from me and don't blindly start drilling away. -edited for spelling.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is a keg included?\n Answer:","completion":" No. You will have to pay a deposit on a keg when you get it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Say I wanted to put this under a table, yet run a tube thru a hole in the table, and have my tower\/tap on the tables surface. can i do that?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes but you would need lomger tubing and a way to close the seal on top of the kegorator to hold in the coolant (like a diaphram). If you wanted to keep the tap tower attached to the kegorator to avoid this, then you would need a taller tap tower as you would lose height running it through a counter top (iow, you wouldn't have enough room below the tap tower to dispense a beer).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is it to convert to a dual tap? Any recommendations on the dual tap to use?\n Answer:","completion":" I easily just converted mine to a dual tap this weekend, and it was pretty easy. The tower I used was the \"Double Tap Draft Beer Tower- Stainless Steel- 3\" Diameter with Perlick Perl 525PC Faucets\" (you can copy\/paste from within the quotes to find here on amazon). I Drilled through the top, and ran the hosing down through the original hole. As this is a plate chiller fridge, there \"shouldn't\" be any refrigerant lines running through the rest of the fridge. Just be VERY VERY careful when drilling to not hit the plate inside the fridge (I nearly had a disaster with mine). Since the adding the new tower, I haven't noticed any issues or changes with the machine. It still runs as often (and loudly) as it did before. PLEASE NOTE: Drill with caution if you pursue this route. I am not a professional, I just made educated guesses when setting this up, so proceed at your own risk.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Did anyone else have to install a tower cooler? If so, where did you run the power cord out of?\n Answer:","completion":" I put pipe insulation around the tubing all the way up to the bar and turned the co2 down to 6 helped out on the foam a bunch\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the inside dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" Handles a full size keg without any room leftover. It has a shelf behind the keg for the Co2 tank.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this unit come with a keg coupler?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It comes with everything you need to get started but I did end up buying a different regulator and larger CO2 canister. I couldn't seem to get the pressure right until I did that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 5 gallon keg doesnt fit! Cant find anyone making the same complaint, so maybe my keg is non standard size?\n Answer:","completion":" Coors Kegs are a bit funky shaped but I have two Dogfish 60 min IPA's in mine right now no problem\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do i set the regulator pressure when i turn on the tank it shoots up to 50psi and when i turn the adjustment knob it wont drop\n Answer:","completion":" Close the tank valve off, pull the relief vent to relieve the pressure, open the valve on the tank back up about a 3\/4 turn. The tank valve does not have to be wide open. Turn the pressure regulator valve counter clock wise to reduce the pressure to the tank. If need be, pull the relief valve and then slowly turn the pressure vale clockwise to increase the pressure to the tank. It may take a couple tries to get it dialed in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: C02 pressure too high\n Answer:","completion":" Hello Danielle, 3-5 Psi is the correct answer. I am on my 8th barrel and this kegerator keeps working flawlessly.If you run it at 10-12 Psi as recommended it will be mostly foam for your first couple beers. 3-5 will be a slower but smoother pour. Enjoy! Remember you can always pull the ring on the coupler to lower the pressure instantly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these non ducted filters attached to the aluminum mesh filter, if so how?\n Answer:","completion":" The charcoal filter is separate from the mesh filter. However, the charcoal filter is designed to (and does) fit very nicely within an indentation engineered into the back of the mesh filter frame and is attached with 2 push on metal clips. No tools necessary. Very simple.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long does these filter last\n Answer:","completion":" The filters I had lasted three years. I had plastic melt on my stove and I used the fan to get rid of the smell. I'm sure that shortened the life of the filter. I had only used the fan less than once a week.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these non ducted filters have the white indicator strip on them and are they a made by broan?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they have the indicator strip and I'm pretty sure they are made by Broan.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the indicator strip to become colored all the way along when it's time to change?\n Answer:","completion":" With my model of vent, the vent pulls from the center. As a result, the indicator strips typically change color from the center out (e.g. where the grease, etc. is being pulled up through it). I often rotate the filters halfway through use, and then replace accordingly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: serial number 010621222009 would this fit the vent ?\n Answer:","completion":" I replaced the crappy filters that came with the unit (helped along by the USPS bending the damn things cracking the aluminum frame by cramming them in the mail box) with these guys. I don't fry anything on the stove top so they haven't seen combat, but still, they look brand new after a couple years use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How often do you change the filters?\n Answer:","completion":" It just depends on how often you use fan, I have been using mine since last October and they aren't dirty yet. love it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these filters come with the clips to hold them in place?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the clips are included.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How can one tell if the range hood is ducted or non-ducted? When the fan is turned on, there's air blowing out from the front of the hood.\n Answer:","completion":" If the air is coming from the hood, then you know it's NOT ducted. Ducted means the air is pushed through a duct to the outside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What does Non Ducted mean?\n Answer:","completion":" Non ducted means the air is not vented outside. It is circulated through these coal filter and put back in the room! So if your stove vent is vented to the outside you would not use these.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why don't reviewers mention the stove model that they were trying to fit? Remarks like: \"They didn't fit my stove.\" don't help much.\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased these for a Sears Galaxy stove. These drip pans are a universal fit and as long as they fit under the grates you will be OK. The pans measure 6 3\/4\" square with a 4 1\/4\" center cut hole. The pans are basically flat on the bottom and could move slightly under the grates. So I really don't think a model number means much as long as the grates are larger than the pans are square. Hope this helps you out. Also I still have the same drip pans on my stove I purchased maybe 3 years ago. The black coating is still intact.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my gas stove has 3 - 2 1\/2\" burners and 1- 3 1\/2 burner- will these fit my stove?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, it should fit both. My stove has both as well, and they fit both sizes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this sold in packs of four?\n Answer:","completion":" They are not sold in packs of 4. There is only 1.

{"prompt":"Question: If we don't have duct, can we use this one?\n Answer:","completion":" It really needs to be ducted. That is the purpose of the fan... to draw smoke and odors out of the kitchen. It doesn't have to be an outside duct if you have an attic area.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is it listed as 42\" wide, but product details say 45\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Someone else asked me about this. It must be a misprint. My hood is 42\" wide, exactly, and has functioned perfectly.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will these fit my older model Frigidaire Electric Stove?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. The pans will fit, but the electric calrod elements might not sit in the alignment hole perfectly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these heavier? Some of the drip pans are tinny, and don't last very long.\n Answer:","completion":" The pans are fairly sturdy, but certainly not the heavy duty chrome I remember from decades ago. They do fit flawlessly, but the main shortcoming is that the finish gets discolored if you heat the coil on the highest setting. For the price, I think they are a good deal. And I have a back-up set to put in place if I want to impress relatives and friends with a pristine range top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the picture accurate of the set? It looks like 2 large and 2 small to me, but I'm needing a set that has 3 small and 1 large in it.\n Answer:","completion":" It has 2 large and 2 small, it is like it's pictured\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do you measure drip pans? outside lip to lip or inside?\n Answer:","completion":" Jerry, we ordered the 6\" and 8\" pans. They actually measure 6-3\/8\" and 8-1\/2\" inside of lip to inside of lip. Those happen to be the same dimensions as the openings on the range top.

{"prompt":"Question: Could you please tell me if these will fit an older GE model RB536DP1WW - thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if they will fit your particular model, but they fit my older model (20+ years old GE).

{"prompt":"Question: does it fit toilets?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, that's how I used them. The water cutoff from the wall is a tee, so one side of the arrester connects to the top of the tee, and the other side of the arrester connects to a flexible hose, which in turn, connects to the bottom of the toilet tank. If you currently have solid copper tubing between the cutoff and the toilet, I would replace it with a reinforced flexible hose. I believe the flexible hose is 3\/8 female on one side and 7\/8 female on the other.\n"}

Lowes doesn't have a direct part for this. plumbing help please!\n Answer:","completion":" I used a Mini-rester to correct a water hammer caused by one of my toilets. I have a Tee water valve coming out of the wall. I turned off the water and removed the copper tube connecting the water valve to the toilet. I used the silver side of the Mini-rester to connect to the water valve. I threw away the copper tube and replaced it with a re-inforced flexible hose to connect from the brass side of the Mini-rester to the toilet. I did not use a compression fitting.\n"}

Can I put a hammer arrestor somewhere between the wall mounted water outlet and the toilet tank.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, that is exactly what the mini rester is designed for. It is how I it installed. I unscrewed the tank line at the wall valve and screwed the mini rester onto the value output and then the line attached to the mini rester. The copper portion of the mini rester can be oriented vertically or horizontally (mine is horizontal)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: For connecting to supply lines under a bathroom sink, should I be getting a 660-TR1 or a 660-TC1?

It is a nice generic range hood...no frills but functions well. Check the switches. One of ours was loose in the package and we had to tighten it a bit. But safe and fine and no problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why do you have 5.99 shipping and when i get to check out it's over 12.00 dollars, I will buy from someone else because that's not right.\n Answer:","completion":" We estimated higher on our ad.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a plain concrete driveway, could I use this to pour over the existing driveway to get a design? Ergo: The weight of a vehicle?\n Answer:","completion":" As to the concrete and the weight of the vehicle, you will need to use a concrete thats rated to meet that requirement. You would also need to poor it deep enough that it wont chip off or crack. The design would be the easy part of it all and after just completing my project and where you are wanting to do this I would suggest turning this and using it as more of a stamp and not a deep cut. So by turning the mold on its top and using it as a stamp without a real deep cut like a path walkway you get the look of the stone and it looks great. You can really get a professional look without anywhere near the cost. I don't know how to post pictures on here or I would. I poored a large area and worked the concrete just as you would for a smooth surface then went back and stamped the area. I am staining the concrete this weekend. I hope this helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have sloping yard. Can I use this in a way that I can create thicker blocks on the sloping side so that everything in the end is level?\n Answer:","completion":" You know- cost wise- you are better off making a regular plate and shoring it up with dirt or rocks. BTW- I collect pretty stones etc and embed them in mine- also have a special one that has the grandkids handprints with ages on it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you fit it into an area that is not the exact dimensions of the cutout? ex area needed to be filled is 48 inches by 37 inches.\n Answer:","completion":" I had a similar problem...I made the mold on plastic on a flat surface, my driveway. Then I broke apart the squares into the 8 separate pieces and like a jigsaw puzzle arranged them till I finally got them to fir\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How thick and wide is the outside border?\n Answer:","completion":" The outside frame is about 2 inches high and 3\/8 to 1\/2 inch wide. It's quite sturdy as you have to compact the cement into the form and it appears strong enough to reuse for mulitple projects.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone done different colors in the separate sections with the quickrete liquid cement color? If so, was it hard to keep the colors separate?\n Answer:","completion":" though coloring the concrete might seem an easy task, getting a consistent color is not. Personally, I set with uncolored concrete, and after it has cured I use concrete stain....turns out great, and gives you more control over color, and patterns\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would it be better if you made these first and let them dry so you can tap them in place in the sand to make them level\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think it's a good idea. hard to make it level for such a big surface. the point to use this is you don't need sand level, so save you work and money.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many square feet does the form cover?\n Answer:","completion":" It's 2' x 2'\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could I use this for a driveway? Would it hold the weight of a vehicle?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the stones would shift under the weight.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it recommended to put gravel down before setting the pavers?\n Answer:","completion":" In my opinion, that would be best. However, as long as the ground is level and compacted it will be fine. I didn't use gravel because that would have required more digging.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long do I need to wait before removing the concrete on the mold? How many minutes?\n Answer:","completion":" We waited for for about 10 minutes. We wanted it to be a little more solid before lifting it. Our patio turned out great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you tell me the size of the louvers inside I'm looking for ones that are 51\/2 inches to replace the ones I have and I would buy the whole piece\n Answer:","completion":" It's 6\" inside.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can I install this over my old one? The old one is in concrete\n Answer:","completion":" No, this cannot be installed over the old one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the exterior dimensions? the picture looks square (which is what i need ... 8\"?) but the stated dimensions are14x11x12.\n Answer:","completion":" The outside dimensions I measure are 8 3\/4\" by 8 3\/4\" ,Hope this help You\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I paint this? I would like to paint it to match my siding color.\n Answer:","completion":" You would have to use a paint product made specifically for plastic. Other types of paint would easily peel off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the real dimensions? is the face 6\" X 6\" and it fits a 6\" pipe???\n Answer:","completion":" Frame, edge to edge, 6\"x6\". The part slips\/fits inside a four inch vent pipe.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this kit fit my Kenmore Elite fridge and freezer pair?\n Answer:","completion":" Its a straight forward trim kit... if the appliances are the same sizes, you should be in good shape. Designed for Frigidaire.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much height does the trim kit add?\n Answer:","completion":" I measured 74 inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: DOes this kit include the leveling system?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Leveling is through the factory front wheels of the refrigerator only. The single kit does come with that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this kit for both units (frezzer\/refrigerator) or is just for a single unit????\n Answer:","completion":" Its for both which units do u have\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you manually fill this machine with an extendable shower head?\n Answer:","completion":" Yep. Also the full line is just rubber hose. Think of it as just a tub lol with its own drain pump and Way of adj.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: WHERE CAN I PURCHASE REPLACEMENT PARTS\n Answer:","completion":" As far as I know the only place is the company (danby.com or whatever their website is). The local dealer ordered the machine from the company for me, and they did not stock any parts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my danby washing machine goes through all cycles except spinning?\n Answer:","completion":" If you own the twin tub or are considering it you need to understand that it is NOT an automatic washing machine. Your typical automatic will fill, wash, drain, spin, rinse, drain, spin, an then repeat the rinse cycle without any intervention from you. This machine is different. You control the filling of the machine with the faucet, you control the length of agitation while washing the clothes, you move the clothes to the spinner, you drain the wash tub, and refill it for the rinse cycle. The machine doesn't have cycles of the sort that you are used to. Your actions determine the cycle. This is the good and bad of this sort of machine. While extremely customizable, it is also more work for the user as you can't just set it and walk away\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Actual size of ice produced, not vague small, medium, large?\n Answer:","completion":" they're pretty small. I was radically disappointed. I expected an ice cube replacement. they're maybe a quarter the size of a normal ice cube. will they work in a pinch? yes. In a cooler climate? yes. On a hot summer day on your boat? hell no. mine sits on a shelf, used it once to see if it worked - haven't used it since- probably never will. complete waste of money. if shipping hadn't been 40 bucks, I would've returned it. oh, and to top it all off - it makes like 12 cubes at a time so if you aren't making ice ahead of time and putting it in a freezer there's no way it will keep up with even four people drinking any cooling required drinks - on the fly, that is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the inside able to be cleaned due to the constant flow of water and it will grow mold and become unsanitary??\n Answer:","completion":" The only place you do not have access to is the water tube that moves the water from the storage tank to the ice maker itself. Everything else you can easily clean. When not using it, I recommend drainin the water and leave the lid open for a couple days to dry it all out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the small setting make the soft ice like you get at Sonic?\n Answer:","completion":" I have only used the medium and I think the small would be the same shape of cube probably but just smaller. I can tell you this though...usually how this thing works is that it makes the ice and when the cubes are first made they are kinda hard but by the time that the bin is more full...when you take out the cubes they are nice and soft and perfect for people like me who like to eat ice without killing their teeth. The shape of the cube is like a bullet with a hollowed out center so they are easy to chomp on if that's what you like but not too soft so that they melt right away. I let mine run all the time and it makes ice till it runs out of water and it has been working great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Its not a freezer unit, so if not used all day the ice will melt and go back into the system? Do the ice cubes ever get stuck together in a clump?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, a little bit but they are quite easy to break apart because the cubes are slowly melting. It's not that bad really. It's not like a frozen bunch of ice that you have to break apart on the cement. Its no big deal really.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Size of machine??\n Answer:","completion":" Size not the problem doesn't make very much ice. It's good for maybe 2 3 people and doesn't keep up if you want to use for long period of time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do it use a lot of electricity if left on all the time\n Answer:","completion":" No only because I never leave small appliances pluged in and on not even the coffee pot\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i attatch a water line to the unit for automatic water refill?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where do you get Parts\n Answer:","completion":" We haven't had to fix it so not sure but would check the manufacture's website. http:\/\/www.edgestar.com\/\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it have a basket or bin for emptying extra ice into freezer?\n Answer:","completion":" A basket not very big and does not make ice very fast. Good for maybe 6 glasses\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I was wondering if the ice is hard enough to serve to my guests for their drinks. I don't want soft ice, it has to be hard for the drinks? Thanks Julie\n Answer:","completion":" OK we drink a lot, Vodka on the rocks works fine for me. I would not consider it as \"hard clear ice\" but because of it's cupped shape it produces ice very quickly, if you use the small setting you get dense ice. Cheers\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Just got mine out of the box. Is the ice supposed to be hollow, half-tubes?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the cubes form around the metal nubs (do not touch the metal nubs, will cause severe burns), therefore they have to be hollow in the middle. Any other questions, please feel free to ask.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this make \"sonic\" ice? also called pearl ice, soft ice\n Answer:","completion":" It's not chewable, however; not as solid as if from a freezer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much ice does the bin hold?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm guessing- 3-4lbs we love ours. Well worth the money. It's fast. Much faster then the refrigerator. Ice machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how well insulated is storage bucket\n Answer:","completion":" I leave ice in it for a couple hours...but it isn't very frozen when I dump it into my freezer. It often clumps together Once dumped in my freezer due to it having started melting. Also if I use the ice straight out of the bucket it melts fairly quickly if its been in the bucket for a couple hours. If you dump it quickly the ice is fine. I don't think you could leave the ice all day and expect it to still be chilled. A few hours at max.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the water source for the ice?\n Answer:","completion":" You have to either fill it up, but I think it also has a connection like that of an ice maker for a fridge. We've had problems with the fridge automatic ice maker line always leaking, that is why we bought this and we fill it by hand. Several things to note, if you don't know them already; it does not keep the ice frozen after making it, you have to empty the bin when it is full. It takes awhile to start making the ice, but once it gets going it really puts out. We've had ours about 3 1\/2 years and the automatic shutoff for when the water is empty and the ice bin is full has stopped working, but that hasn't been much of a problem, we just keep an eye on it, make a bunch of ice and put it in a large ice bin in our freezer. Hope this has helped. P.S. - When and if our's breaks, we will be buying a new one, it has definitely been worth it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much ice the ice maker can make at once? Thank you in advance for your answers!\n Answer:","completion":" Drops a tray about every 10 min. Great for the money and doesn't take much room. We love ours.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Mine after 2 uses is leaking water from the plastic knob. Can I purchase a replacement?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know about replacement parts, I purchased mine from NewAir and had a problem after just a few days. They immediately shipped me a new machine and I put the first machine in the box I got the second machine in and sent it back. They paid shipping both ways so there was no charge to me. I would call them, they are wonderful people and took care of my problem immediately. Also I didn't have my receipt from when I purchased it, all I had to do was go to their website and download a copy. Like I said they are wonderful and sent me a new machine it arrived in 4 days and cost me nothing\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Capacity: My question is how much ice can the unit hold before you need to empty it?\n Answer:","completion":" ROUGHLY 1\/2 GALLON, SEVERAL CYCLES WORTH.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Keep ice frozen? Does this model keep the ice frozen, or does it all start melting as soon as it's made?\n Answer:","completion":" its starts melting at first, and then the whole unit cools down, any ice that melts goes back into the pool of water used to make the ice. After the unit gets going, the ice melts very slowly, you won't be disappointed. If any ice melts, the unit just keeps on making ice so there is always fresh ice in the unit for when you want it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it produce the clear ice as advertised?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the ice is clear unless you have a lot of air in your tap. Then it will freeze whiter with the bubbles.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the thermofuse?\n Answer:","completion":" It's also called a thermal fuse and is located in the back of the dryer on the blower house. When the dryer overheats the thermal fuse cuts off the electricity to the heat source and the dryer. The thermal fuse can't.be reset and must be replaced. Clogged vent tubes full of lint and or debris are usually the causes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fuse work with the Kenmore Elite H3 electric dryer model 110.82822102?\n Answer:","completion":" It should since it matches the part number here (I searched your model#): http:\/\/www.repairclinic.com\/Kenmore-Dryer-Model-11082822102-ID-596836-Parts Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have an old lady kenmore 11078890800 they have discontinued the part is there a compatible fuse I can use or am i out of luck\n Answer:","completion":" I really don't know. I found all info on troubleshooting on YouTube. All info on compatible parts were google searches. The part is cheap can't hurt to try good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have a positive side and negative or does it not matter ?\n Answer:","completion":" NO. It is just a fuse with no polarity.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work for a Kenmore Elite Dryer Model number 110.8787?\n Answer:","completion":" Its all about the part # that is on the thermocouple if its a match then yes cause Kenmore and whirlpool are made at same place just different name\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My dryer goes for a few minutes and then shuts off. It will go back on when button is pushed. Code E 1 Agree?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this part work with Kenmore model gas dryer 110.74622300?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure I have a whirlpool\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it fit med5870two maytag\n Answer:","completion":" More than likely\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work for a kenmore gas dryer model # 110.97572601\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it work for myself it should work for u as well\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What temperature does it turn off at?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure. All I know is the dryer works and I saved over $100. I bought three of them, although of the dryer goes out again, I will probably replace it since there must be something causing it to over heat. I'm hoping that cleaning the air duct tube fixed that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this humidifier have auto shut off when the water tank is empty?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it make white dust?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - if you have hard water. White dust will come from any ultrasonic humidifier that is used with mineral-laden (\"hard\") water. The dust is actually the mineral residue from the water, just like the salty coating you would see in the pan if you boiled salt water until it was dry. I have soft water and do not have a problem with white dust. The key issue with white dust is the water, not the humidifier.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it soak the surface you place it on?\n Answer:","completion":" This is the third winter I have used this humidifier. It has not gotten the top of my dresser wet, not once. This is the first humidifier I have used that did not make the surface wet. Be careful when taking the tank off the base and putting the tank back on the base. I find it easy to do. One hint--make sure the gasket is flat before screwing the lid back on. Then don't tighten it too tight.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how often do you change the filter?\n Answer:","completion":" Once a year\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this humidifier produce the nasty \"white dust\" caused by minerals in tap water??\n Answer:","completion":" I completely disagree with Eugene. Product is well made, quite, easy to clean and fill with water. Very little to none on the white residue. I do recommend this unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this use filters ? I was looking for filter free cool\/warm humidifier ?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it requires filters. One comes with the humidifier and the first one lasted about 6 months for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: we can't stand any lights in our bedroom at night....does this have any lights on it that can't be turned off?\n Answer:","completion":" The indicator lights are very bright and if you're sensitive to that try applying a piece of black electrical tape over the light. I have the same problem with a B&D hand vac.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is it to thoroughly clean the inside of the water tank? Every humidifier I've every had became slimy and mildewy, and most of them had areas\n Answer:","completion":" Very easy. The unit comes with a small brush tucked inside the water holding tank. I also use a wet paper towel on o get mildew out of corners\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Curious if everyone is using distilled water?\n Answer:","completion":" I only use distilled water and like you I was running to the store. I bought a used Water Distiller, Countertop, White Enamel, Glass Collection on Craigslist for $50, the new one runs over $175. It took me a few months looking to find it. My suggestion is to check Craigslist or ebay once a week if you don't want to spend the money for a new one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to clean SPT-SU-4010 Humidifer?\n Answer:","completion":" I just use vinegar, to loosen the deposits, and a brush (they supply a nice little brush) on the base. You can, however, purchase special cleaning fluids for humidifiers if you prefer. For the tank, I use a dilute hydrogen peroxide solution just once a year, usually at the beginning of the season.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the electronic panel is going out; should I fix it?\n Answer:","completion":" My LG is the sorriest piece of equipment I've ever owned. I only need the slightest excuse, (the electronic panel going out,) to replace it...and I' won't replace it with an LG\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Seems like I can smell rubber burning or getting hot?\n Answer:","completion":" Could be the large gasket or roller inside. The gasket is awful to replace.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How Do You Drain the LG WM2016CW Washer? I plan to do this once a month, but even that is a lot of additional maintenance that I didn't have to do with my old washer. :( Anyway, my questions about draining: How much water will come out of the machine...\n Answer:","completion":" thanks for posting this and following up on it. i'll add this to the monthly to-do list.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this stackable with the lgdlg2526w\n Answer:","completion":" I stacked my LG washer and dryer so I could fit them in a closet, but I don't recall which models they are. You do need a stacking kit. I'd also recommend a drain pan under the washer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I can't see any water when washing or rinsing. Is it cleaning my clothes?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it is as long as you use a detergent that is made for high performance washers. It's quite amazing how these new washers get your clothes clean. Whites seem to be the only issue. They get clean, but they loose their brightness over time. You can check the performance of the washer by soiling a hand towel with various stains and letting it dry for a day or two before you wash it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Powder or Liquid Detergent? Which is better to use?\n Answer:","completion":" I just purchased and installed the WM2016CW washer. As a complete newb to the front-loader universe, I set out to run the first load of laundry. I was rewarded with water and suds all over the floor. I called customer service in a panic and the rep told me I probably added too much detergent. Fair enough. Crisis averted. She then went on to lecture me that the WM2016CW is not meant to be used with liquid detergent (even if it's HE). She said it should only use powdered detergent. I referred her to the manual and LG's own website which explicitly state that you can use either in the machine. I'm not sure who to believe, but according to at least one LG customer service rep, the detergent of choice should be powdered.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: filter shows hexagon shape will it fit the round one that is in my humidifier?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it will fit. Note - One time I ordered the filter, which appeared as you see it but actually received a round one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how\/shen do you need new filter ?\n Answer:","completion":" If you're using tap water then know if it's alkaline. The higher the alkalinity, the more often you will need a filter, every 3 to 6 months. If you use filtered or reverse osmosis water, then a filter will last 8-12 months. This also allows the mist to circulate in the air longer. This is what I do and it reduces costs of buying filters.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i need the part that fits on top where the mist come out where and who may have this part?\n Answer:","completion":" You can get this directly from the Supentown website: http:\/\/www.sunpentown.com\/paacforhu.html SU-4010 nozzle, part 20019\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does the filter last if used with distilled water?\n Answer:","completion":" I just use tap water. unit water stays very clean with the filter. It says to replace every season so I do. Don't know if it would last longer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I skip the filter and just add water treatment to it instead. The filter does not work well on it's own.\n Answer:","completion":" Mine works fine! I probably will buy another one soon. I Think you have to use this filter in order to work properly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work in a surround air 2500 humidifier?\n Answer:","completion":" I am guessing not as it only mentions SU-4010 on the box. They mention a 1-800-330-0388 for questions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i need the part that fits on top where the mist come out where and who may have this part?\n Answer:","completion":" I got mine from Sunpentown International and the Model # was F-4010 for my SU-4010 unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am going to travel to Japan. How big is this converter box\n Answer:","completion":" Hi! It's sort of large to travel with...its 9\"W 6\"H and 12\"D..and it is NOT light. Do you need such a large converter to travel with?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am using the transformer for a kotasu in the US. I have blown 2 fuses, and the transformer came with a blown fuse. Is the transformer defective?\n Answer:","completion":" I would be hesitant to trust a Kotatsu with a 500W transformer. Anything that is supposed to generate that much heat could easily pull more than 500W. If the Kotatsu is rated for less than 500W and has a max draw of less than 500W, then yes, it could be a transformer issue, but for something like a kotatsu, I would have gone with a larger transformer to be safe.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would it be safe to plug in a JP powerstrip into this or should I buy two of these? Two JP devices into JP powerstrip into transformer into wall\n Answer:","completion":" Should be fine as long as the two devices together do not exceed the wattage of the step-down. It's good to leave head room, so if the two devices together are under 400 watts (4 amps) you should be fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this unit regulated and linear? I will using it on an electrostatic energizer amplifier (Stax srm-323s)\n Answer:","completion":" I use it as a step down for my stereo amphlier. It was made for the Japanese market.

{"prompt":"Question: hi can I remove that screw in the middle, because I have Power adapters that might touch that.\n Answer:","completion":" You cannot remove the screw because it is holding the grounding metal strip\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there supposed to be instructions inside the box? We didn't get any, just the basic \"read warning before operating\" instructions on the box .\n Answer:","completion":" There were no written instructions in the box. The incoming voltage switch and the power outlets are clearly marked. You set the incoming voltage switch on the back, 120V for American and 100V for Japanese, then you plug into the corresponding outlet on the front to match the voltage of the device needing power.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What's the spec of replacemet fuse?\n Answer:","completion":" 5 amp\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How long is the actual pointy\/hook part that gets pushed into the wall?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say The straight part is between 3 to 3 1\/2 inches. Then it takes the curve. It take a thick wall to make it work good. I have had good luck, and some not.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what happens if you need to remove it?\n Answer:","completion":" No worries, it will fall off of the wall within a few weeks. If not, you can rip it off, along with the paint below it. 0 stars.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you use on the item to be hung?\n Answer:","completion":" Whatever you normally would with whatever type of hanger you would use normally. The hook part is the thing that's out of the wall, so the stuff just plops onto that instead of a nail.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would it hold a mirror of 10-12 lbs ? II plan to put it on the wall, above the sofa. The mirror just has one hole at the back.\n Answer:","completion":" yes if it is new installation\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these be used on a solide wall or only dry wall?\n Answer:","completion":" I think only drywall\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be installed in the drywall encasing sliding doors?\n Answer:","completion":" If you are referring to pocket doors, I don't believe so. The majority of the hook is in the back side of the wall. Most pocket doors fit pretty snuggly, so I don't believe it would work. Sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking for something that will stick to the ceiling and hold a lamp. Will this work?\n Answer:","completion":" Definitely NOT NOT NOT. That is for a picture. I usually use something like OOK 50330 Jumbo Swag Hook with Hardware, White or a swivel hook. And try to put it in a beam by screwing it directly in. Easy that way. Just put a tiny dent in the ceiling to get the screw started. and tighten it. When it gets hard to tighten, use a screw driver and lever it in between the screw and turn it around and around until it is all the way in. Got to be a beam or piece of wood in your ceiling. Find one with a string and a magnet or a stud finder.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my washer is 27.5 wide and 27 deep will my washer fit\n Answer:","completion":" My new Maytag Bravos XL is 27 wide by 27.5 deep and it fits nicely with extra room. The sides do slope so the overall dimensions are not really giving you the exact space available for your machine. I just measured which is a bit difficult with the machine in place. The inside dimensions appear to be around 30.5 x 28.5. We placed the washer with a couple of inches to spare in the back. You don't want to have extra in the front or you will be likely to step on it which over time might crack the plastic. I was very happy with the quality of the pan.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does one install this by lifting the front end of the washer, sliding the pan under and then lifting the back of the washer to finish the job?\n Answer:","completion":" The entire washing machine will need to be lifted up first on one end and then the other. Not to difficult. I lifted up the front end first. Then, slid the tray underneath the washer as far as I could. From that point, I slowly adjusted it into the pan. Then, lifted up the back end with no problem to the side wall of the pan to slide\/moved slightly side to side onto the pan.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how deep is this ? , i need 2.5 inch or more height for my side outlet drain\n Answer:","completion":" this would be perfect for you. It has a cutout on the bottom, and on the side so you can pick either. I used the side for my house setup\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would this pan (with washing machine on top) slide over carpet easily?\n Answer:","completion":" I assume you want the answer to be \"NO!\" :) It's hard to be certain without trying but my *guess* is, no, it won't move around. The washer is heavy and this isn't a slick, easy glide bottom. If you also add a vibration dampening mat under the tray then you may get still better \"adhesion\". Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the inside Dimensions and Outside Dimensions\n Answer:","completion":" The inside dimensions are 27\" x 30\" x 2-1\/8\". The outside dimensions are 30\" x 32\" x 2-1\/8\".\n"}

I have a portable washer and since I live on the second floor this would be a good idea but I need it to slide\n Answer:","completion":" We taped some packaging tape to the bottom of ours, and it slides ok on our linoleum floor. It really will depend on how strong and heavy\/light you are.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Power off delay digital timer stuck at 1:00:00 and whole display keeps flashing. Have tried everything in manual, now what?\n Answer:","completion":" I would try resetting the unit by unplugging or turning the circuit breaker for the unit off and then back on.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Suddenly the light and the fan does not turn on, I have checked power in the circuit is Ok. Any suggestion?\n Answer:","completion":" Does the display panel work?

{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking for crystal clear ice cubes does this filter do that?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure I use this on my sink for drinking water and it removes the foul taste in the water soy guess would be it would give you clear ice\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do I need separate filters for my kitchen sink water and my ice maker line or will one filter both?\n Answer:","completion":" It depends on how you are plumbed. If you have a single line which does both, you only need a single filter. If you want to know about volume, the filter is rated for a specific number of gallons. You will have to use your judgement as to how much water per day you are using. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my water line for ice comes from underneath the house. can i just hook this up with compression fittings to the line that's behind the refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you will most likely need some additional fitting however start with the kit and add required fittings Home Depot or Lowes or Menards should have the fittings\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the kit include hoses?\n Answer:","completion":" Tubing is not provided with filter system. You must purchase your own tubing. Filter head is furnished with tubing quick connect fittings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this kit include all parts that are in the US-EZ-4 kit minus the faucet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it has the filter and the base mounting hardware. All that is needed is the water line in and a water line out. It is a very good filter. I've been using them for 6 years as an external water filter to my frig. It makes the water taste pure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is this manufactured?\n Answer:","completion":" Packaging says it is assembled in China. I assume they mean the filter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: it is 120 v or 240 v ?\n Answer:","completion":" 120V\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it AC powered, or can it connected to 12\/24 volt battery or both?\n Answer:","completion":" No it is AC only, but it only draws 2.7 amps. One of those converters you can run on a 12 volt battery will run it . If you buy one get one that handles at least 5 amps or more. The converter converts 12 volt DC to 110 volts AC. It draws around 1.5 amps while making ice and 2.7 when it goes into the ice dumping process. I love mine. Check out a converter on the net.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the same unit only rebranded as the NewAir Al unit?\n Answer:","completion":" Hey Steve,my edgestar is totally vicicious kicking out cubes, shell out the extra nickel, proof is in the pudding, let it set a day level to let the cooling agents settle, 6 month clean behind the fan, ie radiator, mucho ice O , enjoy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: In the photo the cubes look white and cloudy. I want a clear clean cube. I am trying to avoid the ugly cloudy cubes. How are they?\n Answer:","completion":" They are cute little long round cubes. Mine has 3 sizes. Not a big difference between sizes but you can tell there is a change in the sizes.

{"prompt":"Question: I have a mod# IP220SS and need a ice basket for it, I cant get info on this mod.?\n Answer:","completion":" EdgeStar has videos on periodical maintenance and other issues. If you still have your operators manual, it should have an address, phone number, web contact point, etc. May l ask what happened to your original basket, or do you have mischevious kids like l had, lol. Another suggestion is shop at your various office, hardware dot depots. Personally l'd dig out the manual and get with EdgeStar for 2 replacement baskets, one for a spare.

{"prompt":"Question: will not make Ice, keeps saying to add water which has been done. Did turn off the unit unplugged it and started over still having the same issue.\n Answer:","completion":" Are you filling it to the max fill line? It usually takes a couple of minutes for the water signal to reset. Mine did that and I lightly banged the sides and it started working. If that's not the problem then you may have to call Edge Star for help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The description of \"what's in the box\" doesn't mention a filter. Does that need to be purchased separately? If so, what kind of filter is needed? T\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it comes with a washable filter.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the underside one flat plane so that this is easy to clean? Is it otherwise easy to clean the underside?\n Answer:","completion":" Around the lights is flat. Of course where the filter is, is not a place to wipe clean. The one thing I don't like is most of the smoke gets sucked up around the lights and not up thru the filter. They should have sealed the lights.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it hardwired\n Answer:","completion":" yes. it is hard wired.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size is the output duct requirement?\n Answer:","completion":" 6 inches\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: At what temp is the excessive heat that the fan will start by itself?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't believe that it has a thermostat to automatically start it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I m just in need of the blower motor for my pm 390hs range hood do u just selll the blower motor ?\n Answer:","completion":" My understanding is yes after talking to the company.

Would be interesting to know what you find out. Thanks\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be vented from the top OR the back? I need an insert that vents from the back.\n Answer:","completion":" It can only be vented from the top. Although, charcoal filters can be used to recirculate. If it's recirculating, the vent from the top needs to be vented to the kitchen space and not through the attic.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much of an energy load (watts or amps) does this range hood put on an electrical circuit.\n Answer:","completion":" Based on Broan's website, it's rated at 2.9 amps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need the liner or can it be used without? I'm building a custom hood to fit in a 30\" space.\n Answer:","completion":" The simplest solution is to use the liner. Just make sure the controls are to front. The 390 is really quiet and the lighting is very good. Bob\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this mount in the ceiling soffit above a range?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I believe so provided the dimensions fit. Although it does not require outside ductwork, it does need to be vented into attic or have a return air vent. It's worked extremely well for our needs. I had read that if you do heavy stovetop cooking, such as wok-type, a different system would be better. The only other thing I can think of is that your soffit might be too high for effectiveness. Ours is 32\" above stovetop. They had a model set-up at Lowes that might help you decide.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it ventless or does it need to be vented\n Answer:","completion":" It's designed for a vent. It has an 8 inch outlet with a flapper valve to prevent downflow when the unit is off. You may be able to get a recirculation kit, but I vented mine, so I don't know for sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Stupid question...does this hood come with a motor? My parents are insisting that for the $, it can't come with a motor -- that it is just the hood!\n Answer:","completion":" yes, fully functional and running as we speak\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is everything needed for operation included with this unit?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes,it can be vented horizontal or vertical,with the included hardware. Very good unit for those of us on a budget. Arrived well packed and undamaged!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there any hardware (such as screws) included in the package? I am aware that the light bulbs and filters are not.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. There is a small package with everything in it. My husband missed it. They are on the side in the cardboard. A woman can find it. :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the bulbs included? Do we have to buy separately? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Bulbs are not included. You'll need to buy them separately. On Amazon I bouught (2)-Sylvania #14700 50-watt PAR20 wide flood halogen bulb. They light very well on low setting, and extremely bright on high setting.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How \"brainless\" is it to turn the light \/ fan off? I like simple pushbuttons for \"off\" so I can jab at it, no thinking. How EZ are rocker switches?\n Answer:","completion":" It is so easy to turn off or on, I do it with my eyes closed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this really 10\" from top to bottom? I like the quiet aspect but if it's really 10\" thick, it won't work above my range.\n Answer:","completion":" More like 7\"--I measured it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it 100% Stainless steel? I have seen so called Stainless units that have only the walls in stainless and the top of it is not stainless and rusts.\n Answer:","completion":" It is 100% stainless steel.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a way to fasten the back of the hood to the wall. Is there a way to fasten the sides of the hood to cabinets sides\"\n Answer:","completion":" This model was meant to be fixed from the top. You could probably drill your own holes for a side installation and in the back for more support. It could be done but would be a pain.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with the filters? Finding info on the web that says it does..but others here are saying it does not.\n Answer:","completion":" It does come with the reusable filters if you are going to vent it, but not with the charcoal filters if used not vented\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Installed range hood on Dec. 27, on Jan 5 it blowed one of the lights, do you have any ideas why?\n Answer:","completion":" Unless there was an abnormal voltage surge, it would have been the light bulb that was bad. Halogen bulbs get very hot and if the seal for the bulb is weak. the expansion and contraction from the heat would cause a leak, leading to a failure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What bulbs does it use?\n Answer:","completion":" You can use A15 40W bulbs if you don't want to use Halogens. Halogens are too hot for me. I started out with the incandescent A15 and saw some LED bulbs at Lowes or Home Depot (Utilitech - Pro , model LR140M\/LED). They are 4.5W, 300 lumens and made for use in a damp environment. They are not cheap but the lighting is very clean.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it hard wired or plug in?\n Answer:","completion":" You can wire the fan either way. It just depends on what you have for the electrical connection now. The connecting wire is not included with the fan. I used the one that was already installed with my old fan. It has a normal 3 prong plug. Since the plug and wire don't move once the fan is installed, the old wire was like new.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this Broan QS230SS come with air filters? Picture does not show all details.\n Answer:","completion":" The QS23OSS comes with a single, stainless steel mesh grease filter-- easily removed, cleaned and replaced-- but no air filter per se. We have had very good use of the unit for nearly two years, with one caveat: for several months, both lights came on, but then one would go out. After awhile, it seemed to correct itself, and that problem has not recurred. Advise against using halogen bulbs, as they take a lot of wattage and get very hot.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I had the hood installed to be vented to outside. Air blows out the top vents. Very loud clicking on 3rd speed. ????\n Answer:","completion":" Call the person who installed it and have them fix it. They most likely did not remove the blocking panel that opens the hood to the outside vent. The instructions are pretty clear that you need to do this or else it will simply blow air back in your face. The clicking is probably a similar issue - that your installer didn't open it up and put the right panels in place and remove the securing packing tape.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: hood vent out back?\n Answer:","completion":" It can be vented out the back or thru the front.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this model have the damper included for the seven inch duct.\n Answer:","completion":" The fan comes with a 7 inch duct plate for you to attach the duct to the fan. There was no damper included.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can an extended warranty be purchased for this product?\n Answer:","completion":" Accompanying literature indicates a one-year warranty period. Many credit card companies extend warranty periods on items purchased with their cards; I would suggest investigation.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I've had my vent hood for about 3-4 months. This morning it started making rapid-fire clicking noises (nothing turned on). Anyone had this problem?\n Answer:","completion":" We have been using this hood since 5-13. No problems. I don't think it is electrical but turn off the breaker & see if it stops. Remove the filters & look in the exhaust. Use a flash light. Start & stop the fan. Unfortunately I have no further ideas. Hope you find it. Let us know.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my cabinets will allow 30 inches wide. will it fit?\n Answer:","completion":" i bought th white and it fits perfectly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you have to used a duct.\n Answer:","completion":" No, you have an option to use it ventless or vented. Very pleased with the product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions.\n Answer:","completion":" Buyer beware as there are a TWO different filters being sold under the SAME basic HC-504 nomenclature. The original\/good version is 1.25\" thick, whereas many of the more recent offerings are only 0.75\" thick, therefore with MUCH less moisture-delivering efficiency\/life, yet at the same price. Worse yet, often the images shown in Amazon are dimensionally proportional to the original\/good ones but what they really ship is the inferior version - I know because I just returned six filters to Amazon but got stuck with shipping charges and wasted time. Someone else suggested another source (filters-now dot com) and I'm sending them an inquiry based on the above. (PS- some of the filter offerings tout a blue \"dust catching\" wrap that IMHO is pure marketing hype.)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how often do you have to change the filter in the HCM-350 Honeywell Cool Mist Humidifier\n Answer:","completion":" Twice\/year. More often if I used humidifier in summer months.\n"}

Honeywell Home Environment products (such as fans, heaters, portable air purifiers & humidifiers) that you see at retail are manufactured by a company called Kaz, Inc. (Southborough, MA) and have been for the last 9 years or so. Great company with Great products.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Anyone know if this will fit in a Vicks Starry Night Cool mist humidifier?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does. I'm using this filter in our Vicks Starry Night humidifier. I like these filters more than the Vicks replacement and the Protec ones are junk, even though they appear to be made by the same company.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this compatible with the Honeywell Easy to Care Cool Mist Humidifier HCM-710?\n Answer:","completion":" according to the box, yes this filter will work with the HCM-710 series\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit Honeywell 6011i inside dia.8in outside 19 in 7and half tall\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure. I looked up the your Honeywell model 6011i and it specifies it uses a HC-14 replacement filters. So in my opinion I would say no, it is not the correct filter. Your humidifier looks taller, and this particular filter is shorter, so I would look for the correct replacement filter on Amazon which should be an HC-14. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what fits the model HCM - 890\n Answer:","completion":" There are 2 filters that I know of: Honeywell HC-888N and HC-888-TGT. The second one is the better, more expensive, filter; but either will work in the HCM-890 Humidifier.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" 33.5hx19Wx19.5\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this on carpet? I don't want something that will leak or potentially start a fire. If no, what can I buy something to put underneath? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" This small refrigerator really needs to be raised up by means of some kind of base, otherwise you're on your knees looking into it. I happened to find a suitable nicely made wooden crate at an estate sale, which I cleaned up and painted and which serves perfectly. Brings it up about 12 inches, so I can access it more easily and comfortably. This fridge has never leaked except when I defrosted it and left the door open--that was completely my fault. I think you could just put it on a slab of plywood cut to size, if you wanted to use it in a carpeted area--though even this may not be necessary. Hope this helps. It's an excellent little refrigerator. I've had mine nearly two years and I love it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My dorm limits the amount of amps to 11 or less. How many amps does this fridge use up?\n Answer:","completion":" This is a very nice fridge\/freezer. At start up it ran at 4.6 amp. Once it reaches temp, it runs at less than 1 amp. You will be very happy with this appliance. With the seperate compartment, you get very little frost, too.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, I'd like to order this for my daughter who will be heading to college next month. Is there a way to purchase and delay shipping?\n Answer:","completion":" Buy the HD-113F Kenmore from Sears.

They also have layaway and local service to help your daughter in the event she has some repairs or needs to return it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: does it fit left or right side interchangeably?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does fit interchangeably on the left or the right. The only way you will ever be able to tell the difference is if you use one side of your stove more than the other and clean that pan more or less than you should. Funny!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it fit a Kenmore stove model#790.71344700 ?\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not fit well. It leaves the cooking surface out of level.\n"}

GE says there should be a difference between the left and right because of the curvature at the top outer corners.\n Answer:","completion":" These are metal, and pretty heavy-duty metal at that, so if you were wanting to trim them to fit, I don't think that will work.

These Samsung filters used to fit no problem, but now the filters I used to order (still being sold in same old boxes) don't--the sprockets on the neck have been redesigned and do not match the picture on the package. I have not found a way to order the correctly-fitting original filters from Samsung.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is DA29-00003F the same as DA29-00003G?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the \"F\" and \"G\" are identical in fit only. As for filtration, the \"F\" is strictly an \"aesthetic\" filter, meaning that it filters out chlorine taste, and cloudiness only. The \"G\" filter, on the other hand, is a \"health\" filter, meaning that it filters out cysts, chemicals, and heavy metals (lead, mercury) contaminants and so-forth. The \"F\" is a waste of your money. Pay a little bit more to protect your health, and stick with the \"G\" model. By-the-way, don't purchase any of the cheap, off-brand filters as they are every one the equivalent of the \"F\" model Samsung Aqua Pure filter. Buy only the name brand \"G\" model Samsung Aqua Pure filter. I have researched this extensively, and am a retired RN with 30 years experience, and very extensively trained, and well-read, so I do know that of which I speak about. Hope my little lecture helps! :-) Michael\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This filter works great and is very easy to install. But, I've noticed when installing the filter that the marks on the filter NEVER line up with the \"lock\" marks on the fridge. Does this happen to anyone else? Filter goes on EASY, but I'm always...\n Answer:","completion":" Here is the answer we got from Samsung tech who was called to the house when the new fridge water tasted terrible. The filter has to be inserted and turned to catch, THEN PUSHED UPWARD AND TURNED TO ENGAGE THE FILTER COMPLETELY. Then the arrows will line up. We knew something was wrong when there was no water in the original filter when first removed. Apparently, the guys who installed the fridge never fully engaged the filter, and I followed their lead. The filter works perfectly now. We were also cautioned about \"generic\" filters that are knock-off quality and not able to filter as well or as long. There are duplicate Samsung filters made in Korea that are low rated but look exactly the same. Genuine Samsung filters with a higher rating are made in Mexico. Hope this helps.\n"}

I ordered the 3 pack and 2 of 3 never worked. See my recent post from me and others on the many, many complaints. Even after flushing 5-Gal through the filter there was a terrible chlorine taste. If you do purchase I would get them from Lowe's. You will need to find your model number which is inside the door. GOOD LUCK!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I purchased my Samsung a year ago. I just hooked up the water line and the replacement light came on? Why did it expire when I've never run the water?\n Answer:","completion":" The replacement light simply runs on a timer so it is likely just a coincidence that it came on now. There are no sensors that measure the quantity of water through the filter or quality or water output. Simply reset the filter reminder on the panel and wait till the next time that it comes on to replace.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Instructions say to turn off water valve before installing, meaning refrige would have to be pulled out from enclosure each time. Is this true?\n Answer:","completion":" That's a good question. I must have missed that in my reading of the instructions. I have changed 4 since I've had my fridge and I've never shut off the valve. I simply untwist the old one, pull it out, line up the marks of the new one to the housing, and turn whichever way the arrow says to until it locks in. Then I \"run\" the water until it flows like its supposed to. The only other guidance I have is to check your fridge manual for the true directions. Best of luck!!!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this thermostat work if you only have central electric heat and a central AC as in a mobile home.\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure about working on a mobile home ac.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with a 2-stage Bryant AC\/Heat gaspac? The thermostat the dealer installed is programmable and we don't need it.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes , this tstat will work on your hvac system. If you dont want to use program, just push the hold button.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how easy is it to install\n Answer:","completion":" From a \"hardware\" standpoint, there is literally two holes that need to be drilled and the thermostat's BASE is fixed to the wall, then you connect each wire accordingly, and then you fix the thermostat onto it's base. That's it. Obviously you will need to know how to hook up the wires, a good idea is to take a photo of your previous thermostat's wiring prior to removing it. From a \"configuration\" point of view, the thermostat needs to be set up to match the equipment that you have (number of heat sources, Celsius or Farenheit, etc.) , however default values will work for a conventional cooling \/ heat pump unit.

I have been reading that the filter top part breaks or the filter explodes ..... but i have been using one for over 6 months no issues yet. If i do I will update my answer. Have a great day. If for water or ice I recommend the lvl 4 filter. I have crappy water and it makes my ice taste much better.\n"}

I realize I'd probably need to support the end of the filter, doing this to make sure it's level and no side load maybe causing a leak. It's very difficult to get my side by side out, I want to...\n Answer:","completion":" My educated guess is yes it will. Since the unit is under pressure at all times, and it doesn't leak when sealed, it should work in any position.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a culligan IC-102 filter on fridge, will this replace that filter?\n Answer:","completion":" waterfilters.net has Culligan filters. Call them at 1-888-801-7873. They probably have your answer.\n"}

They are good quality but in removing them to clean we have lost two little rubber inserts which holds the knob steady on the male inserts that they attached too. Now two of the knobs are loose. i need to get a hold of G.E. to get replacements. I hope this addresses any of your concerns.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this hood wall exhaust through the top? Is there an exhaust kit available with this model?\n Answer:","completion":" The hood includes the exhaust mechanism, filter and light fixture, and once you install it (under a cabinet or all of the way to the ceiling) you must purchase the necessary exhaust pipe to either take the exhaust straight thru the roof, or get a 90 degree elbow (and the necessary pipe) to bend it (in the attic) in order to take the exhaust to the (side) eve of the house. Exhausting to the eve of the house is more economical and reduces the cost\/risk of cutting thru the roof and the potential water leak etc. The elbow and aluminum exhaust pipes that I purchased at Home Depot (very economical) do not have to be sealed since they fit into one another tightly. One thing that I noticed on my hood is that the light switch occasionally stick when I try to turn the light on. Although I have not done it, I am sure that a bit of WD40 sprayed on the side of the switch would do the job. Considering the cost of this product, it is an excellent value. The unit is very easy to install. We are retired and we would buy this item again. We have stainless steel appliances and this hood matches seamless. To impress family and friends there are other hoods that would do the job at higher costs. I suggest that you follow the installation instructions as far as the distance of the hood from the top of the stove. Too close to the top of the stove will impede your working room, too far from the top of the stove, will diminish its power to exhaust the heat properly. It was suggested to us, and we followed, to install the hood where the very bottom of the hood is in line with your eye brows. It works fine, as exhausting the heat\/smoke and it gives us plenty of working room with the pots etc. I hope this info helps.....\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the height of each shelf? I read that you can store 3-liter bottles on the top shelf?\n Answer:","completion":" The height is 6\" between shelves(with some adjust ability on a track) however the top shelf is recessed back about 7 inches so you can stand a large bottle on the lower shelf and it wont interfere with it. They are adjustable as well. Keep in mind this is a beverage center so the lower half is all wine and the top is a smaller compartment for soda, beer water etc. Looks like with some adjusting you could fit a 3 liter I hope this helps..\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Which filter to buy??? What is the difference between this PUR filter 4396841 for $35, the cheaper Pur PBSS one for $29 or the 4396710 for $35???\n Answer:","completion":" If all the filters are original PUR* replacement filters, the filter medium will be the same. Someone has posted that the PBSS filter is inferior to the others, but I see no data to back up that assertion. The difference is in the amount of water they can filter before recommended replacement and the flow rate. The \"universal\" PBSS filter is rated at 100gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396710 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396841 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.85GPH flow rate. Strangely, both the 100 & 200 gal. capacity models are recommended for 6 months replacement. You would think the 200gal. models would last longer. Some whirlpool refrigerators offer what's called \"fast-fill\" systems, which dispense the water almost twice as fast as \"normal\" systems. It stands to reason that the 4396841 would be best if you want\/need the higher flow rate. It also stands to reason that the lower flow rate models probably filter better since the cartridges (and presumably the filter mediums) are exactly the same size (educated opinion). I have decided on the 4396710 for my refrigerator. I researched a lot for this answer, I hope it helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: The number I have is 4396710 . Can I use the same 4396841 PUR Push Button Side by Side Refrigerator Water Filter\n Answer:","completion":" I agree with Brett below. In looking at the picture of both, they look the same, there a 2 nipple ends that go in first. On my Fridge(Whirlpool Gold Side by Side) there is only one way to slide it in, so it is impossible to insert incorrectly. The filter is slotted to match up with the filter hole in the refrig. See answer found online: Important note: The filters 4396841 and 4396710 are interchangeable and offer the same level of filtration. However, the 4396841 offers two flow rates (0.50 gpm and 0.85 gpm) which are necessary in some applications. If your refrigerator has a \"fast fill\" function in your dispenser, you should use 4396841. Otherwise, the 4396710 will work properly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this filter fit amana\n Answer:","completion":" Here are the compatible part numbers. You need to check your current filter number and see if it matches. The genuine OEM Whirlpool \/ KitchenAid 4396841 Refrigerator Ice & Water Filter replacement fits Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Amana, Jenn-Air, and Kenmore side-by-side refrigerators with a push-button filter located in the grille at the bottom of the fridge. If you see the words \"Fast Fill\" or \"PUR Measure\" on your water dispenser, stick with this filter (4396841) because 4396841 has dual flow rates of 0.50 gpm and 0.85 gpm. If you don't see those words on your dispenser, you may upgrade to the newer, improved Whirlpool 4396710 filter. The newer 4396710 filter removes more contaminants than the older the 4396841 filter, including cysts and turbidity.

{"prompt":"Question: Lint filter: Does anyone knows where I can purchase the black filter behind the white filter and filter cover?\n Answer:","completion":" This is the review that helped me: \" 4.0 out of 5 stars Great dryer! The filter does get clogged though...., March 6, 2012 By Benjamin D. Garlock (San Francisco, CA) - See all my reviews (REAL NAME) Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: Haier HLP140E 2-3\/5-Cubic-Foot Compact Tumble Vented Dryer (Kitchen) I've had a great experience with this dryer and the washer that pairs with it. I live in a tiny studio apartment in Manhattan. The only problem is the wool filter in the back eventually becomes way too dirty to be useful. Even using the lint wand, it eventually just gets too chewed up. After a good deal of digging I found that you can replace the filter. If you Google the part number it is called a \"Panel Top WD510023\". They were about seven dollars with shipping. Other then that, it's a great dryer! \" I'm going to go and look up the part.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How to vent this dryer? I\"m thinking about getting this dryer, but i don't know how to vent this dryer.I live an apartment and I dont have an exterior vent.Do I need buy vent kit or not?\n Answer:","completion":" I totally agree. There's no need to vent this dryer and i don't even use a \"Vent kit\" I just place it up again the wall and use the adapter that comes with it to vent up from the back. The filter's screen makes it so little if no lint get's out. In the winter it's a free heater and humidifier, in the summer your central a\/c should have no problem keeping the house cool. It put's out very little heat in the long run and if you just wait to you go to work\/school to turn it on then it's literally no bother.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Capacity question? Can I dry bathrobe, two queen-size sheets, large jacket in this dryer ?\n Answer:","completion":" You can do 2 bathrobes, queen size sheets or even a jacket. I have found that i can do 5 or 6 pairs of pants at one time or even a small blanket. All things considered as long as your willing to wait for it to dry you wont have a problem with any of those. The dryer is more forgiving than the matching washer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Electric bill: Did you notice a huge electric bill jump when using your portable dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" Considering i do 2-4 loads with the washer and dryer combo a week i really didn't notice a change in the bill, in fact it was negligible increase. One thing i do that others may not be able to do is i wash a load or 2 before i go to sleep with and toss the wet laundry in the dryer and wait till i leave in the morning before i turn it on. When i leave in the morning i turn the A\/C off anyways so even if it increases the temp and humidity in the apartment i never notice it. Coming home turn the A\/C on and fold clothes and everything is good. If it helps you the dryer uses about as much electricity as a hair dryer or a space heater (My kill-a-watt says between 900-1000w during use). The matching washer uses literally a fraction of that. I also use auto dry instead of timed dry and have never had a problem with it. But more to the point after one full load from my 1cf haier washer i used about .75kwh or about 9 cents to dry it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will this fit a kitchen aid model KSB560080\n Answer:","completion":" This looks like the part (I believe perhaps it was a gasket, but not sure of it's part name since I replaced it quite sometime ago). It did fit our Kitchen Aid Unit very well, along with the turning blades. The parts that I ordered from Amazon were relatively inexpensive, but certainly did the job and our expensive Kitchen Aid mixer has been working very well and that makes my wife very happy. Hope this helps you. You are not looking at much money here in the event that the part is not the right one. I would give it a try. Good luck.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How accurate is the HUMIDITY reading on these? Please only answer if you've tested\/compared it to other devices and\/or local weather stations. THANKS\n Answer:","completion":" The humidity reading on my old unit that eventually failed got funky and was reading about 30 percent lower than what it should have been. But the replacement unit I bought over a year ago has been right on the money so far. What's weird, however, is that the humidity reading INDOORS on my MAIN unit has gone bonkers now and is reading about 20 percent less than it should be. So go figure. But I have a digit-readout humidifier that I use in the winter, so that's not as important to me as the temperature.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the sensor get wet? Live on south side of a apartment, but our mail box faces the north. Am I correct, the most accurate reading is from North?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I've had my sensor outside year round, from 90+ to -25. In extreme cold I've noticed a problem that it changes from degrees F to degrees C but other than that the sensor works great.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the procedure for batteries?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know . I got one for my old unit and it works just fine . I hung it up out side in the shade and out of the rain and snow . I guess when it stops sending a signal I will replace the batteries . I think they will last for a year or more .

{"prompt":"Question: One of my bulbs went out and I am having a hard time removing it..should it just pull out or does it screw in?\n Answer:","completion":" Unscrew it!

{"prompt":"Question: hi if i order this model and ship to canada is the warrenty valid in canada\n Answer:","completion":" Honestly I do not know. But on the other end the only moving part is an electric motor. What can go wrong?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why do I hear a clicking sound?\n Answer:","completion":" I know this may be obvious, but pull off the left filter and see if you can see something touching the fan. You may have to pull off the shroud to see further if nothing is easily seen...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The product lacks of instruction of installing rear venting range hood. There's no accessories come with it. Please help!\n Answer:","completion":" You have to buy a six-inch one from Home Depot. The pipe hole size on the range hood itself is seven. A bit of workaround needed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why the picture looks different from Zephyr website for ak2100a?\n Answer:","completion":" Only difference appears to be the control panel on Amazon picture. But product description is as on Zephyr Typhoon page and that is what was delivered (6 Speed Electronic Touch Controls Featuring Auto Delay-Off and Blue LED Lighting). Mounting was 4 screws - you need a long phillips screwdriver and an assistant. Works very nicely. Much quieter than inexpensive fans.

{"prompt":"Question: One question for those with color White: is it made of stainless steel too (just painted in white)? Not made of metal, I hope? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" I have the black one, so feel free to discount my answer. I \"think\" my black one is painted metal, instead of painted stainless. Make sure read my earlier review in case my experience helps you. Once installed, it has been holding up and doing its job well over the past year and half.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the weight of this rang hood?\n Answer:","completion":" its about 20lbs but its made very cheaply had to fix ours twice fan transformer spot weld came off . get what you pay for!!!!!!!!!!!!we replaced with a ge caf hood,so far its nice 300 more but no headaches good luck\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How is the noises level of this range hood?\n Answer:","completion":" On high this fan is moderately loud (my kids have to turn up the kitchen tv), but it works amazingly well!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the fiting sizes on this?\n Answer:","completion":" I have the filter aboard my boat (which is under cover for the winter) but as I recall the fittings are standard garden hose connections. I use it to fill the water tank on my boat because the water line from ashore sometimes has algae in it from being infrequently used and subject to sunlight and warm temperatures.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this RVF rv water filter come with a filter ?\n Answer:","completion":" Answer here...You can buy replacements even at Walmart.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are their connection replacement (male &amp; female) for culligan rvf-10, water hose connections?\n Answer:","completion":" No. could not find any at home depot etc.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this housing hold the d 20 cartridge ?\n Answer:","completion":" The only cartridge listed in the instructions is the D-15. So I would say no.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the temperature rating on these? Can they be used to filter water from the water heater?\n Answer:","completion":" We always used ours from the source to the rv, so temperature was never an issue. The water was heated after it flowed through the filter and into the rv. I think you would want to do it that way, because then you minimize or eliminate any dissolved salts in the water before the water heater.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: HOw much does it reduce the water flow... RV already has problems with pressure after you put limiter on inlet.\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't put a limiter on, and there was no difference in the flow pressure. But that could change from one campgrounds to the other. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: could i use this product to avoid water spots when rinsing my car?\n Answer:","completion":" I doubt that it would eliminate the possibility of water spots when water dries in the car without using a towel. Depending on the filter type used it certainly would reduce the particulate matter that is left behind when water dries but it would not turn the water into the equivalent of distilled.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What does the 5 year warranty cover? Wanted to make sure it covered the parts along with the housing.\n Answer:","completion":" Honestly I do not know. However, several years ago I had the female connection break and they sent a replacement free of charge. But I since have replaced both the plastic female and mail ends with metal ones. The reason...we RV a lot and I felt more secure since we hook up and unhook the filter so frequently. Otherwise I do not see any reason for the unit to not last way more than 5 years. We have been very pleased the filtering system.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could you tell me if the inlet and outlets are 3\/8?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't recall, but I will say they are plastic and leaked horribly even when I used Teflon tape. The inlet house simply blew out twice so I to modify with connectors purchased at HD.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do i install\n Answer:","completion":" Measure, trim, screw it onto the lower back (interior) of the door....then adjust the height using the screws. 10 min job.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Specs say item fits 1 3\/4\" door, but flat part of bottom piece is 1 1\/2\" and then there is a 1\/4\" bubble. Is door suppose to sit on bubble?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes the bubble will be under the door on the side that faces out of your home. It is there so you do not see a gap from the outside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much of the bottom of the door itself is covered on the side without the screws?\n Answer:","completion":" None.....just the weatherstripping.....but it's below the door\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to keep my foster kittens from going from room to room; I want to cut the strips to fit the folding doors. Can I?o\n Answer:","completion":" The strips can be cut using a utility knife. The strips are made to fit an exterior door, so they are about 1 and 1\/2 inches deep. That might be kind of deep for a folding door.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the location\/spacing of the screw holes?\n Answer:","completion":" Holes are 8\" on center.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this come in 32\"?\n Answer:","completion":" We don't carry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long does beer stay fresh? how often do you have to change CO2 and where do you buy those? do smaller kegs stay fresh longer? how\/when do u clean?\n Answer:","completion":" A tapped keg of beer should stay fresh 3-4 mths. You can get the co2 same place you buy kegs. Bought the kegerator Dec 2013 we have averaged 1 keg a month and we have changed the co2 tank once. I bought a cleaning kit same time I purchased the kegerator and we have cleaned it just once, I believe we should of cleaned a little more often. We love thr kegerator works great and keeps beer cold.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the temperature easily adjust? I need it to hold it at 50-55 degrees is there a setting for that?\n Answer:","completion":" It's not quite as simple as a set and forget digital setting. Yes, I believe it will be able to hold your temperature range of 50 to 55 degrees. It will probably be able to do that without having to disassemble the thermostat too. You will need, however, to monitor the temperature until it gets to your desired range. I have one of those atomic clock things that has an outside temperature transmitter. I just put that transmitter inside the kegerator. Mine keeps track of the temp range in the past 12 hours and resets at midnight each day. I just went down and checked mine. Now, keep in mind that I actually have mine set to keep my beer in the mid 30's. I like cold beer! Anyway, the range of mine since midnight last night has been between 31 and 38 degrees. It was precisely 33 degrees when I just checked. It holds that pretty consistently day in and day out now that I have my dial set correctly. By the way, it is a rotary dial, with \"colder and warmer\" direction. There is no temp set. So it may take you some trial and error but I think you should be able to get there pretty quickly. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this unit including a keg as pictured ?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the keg is for illustrative purposes. However, it does include everything else in that picture.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you put the CO2 tank inside the kegerator or does it have to be mounted on the back?\n Answer:","completion":" With 1\/6 of a keg it will fit. I have seen home made kegerators with the tank inside. Tape the hole in the back so no cold air gets out. Enjoy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: using the biggest keg this dispenser can hold how long will it take to empty using 12, 12 oz servings a day\n Answer:","completion":" The biggest dispenser it will hold is a full keg which is 15.5 gallons. If my math and measurements are correct, it will last 13.77 days.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit a full size leinenkugels keg? We're wanting summer shandy all summer.\n Answer:","completion":" To be honest, I don't know what a leinenkugels keg is... if it is a standard 15.5 gallon keg it will (barely). In fact, on all of the 15.5 gallon kegs, I had to either tape the door shut or in one case, make a tape seal around the door because the door would not close.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'd like to convert the beer line for use with corny kegs. What size barb fits the beer line?\n Answer:","completion":" The beer line has a nut that is pre-attached that screws on to the coupler that attaches to a standard sized American beer keg. This link may help explain it better visually. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-uBwEDDoYY0 I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the temperature easily adjust? I need it to hold it at 50-55 degrees is there a setting for that?\n Answer:","completion":" Bought this as a wedding gift. It is pretty much the same as a mini fridge. Dial for temperature, like 1-7 was the setting if I remember correctly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this hold the standard normal keg? I drink keystone 1\/2 kegs and im not quite sure what they mean by Does NOT support use of Coors, Miller rubber\n Answer:","completion":" No It does not. From front to back its only 12 1\/2 inches. The diameter of the quarter and 1\/2 barrels are 16 1\/8 I use a 1\/6 of a barrel its 55 bottles and lasts me 2 weeks. Plus it only weights 58 pounds.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the unit have an energy guide sticker that estimates energy use for one year, like refrigerators do?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know yet. Delivered as a gift out of state. Did you try their web site? There's also a number of sites that rate these devices, so they might include energy info.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this strap block the TV from tilting backward too?\n Answer:","completion":" No it only helps with tilting forward.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these straps also prevent the tv from falling backwards into the wall?\n Answer:","completion":" Using museum wax underneath the front of the tv stand prevents the tv from falling backwards...used in conjunction with the straps to prevent the tv falling forward...it gets the job done. The strap kit I purchased at Home Depot comes with 2 oz. of museum wax to serve the purpose of the tv falling backwards. Museum wax is a microcrystalline product which provides instant grip to collectible items, etc. Sticks to wood too! :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this worth the money if you can't use the bolt to put into studs in the wall? So just using adhesive? Our walls are plaster &amp; lathe.\n Answer:","completion":" We anchored our tv to the tv stand,not the wall. It works.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the adhesive work with a brick wall?\n Answer:","completion":" Hmm... I wouldn't be entirely confident in answering that. I dont believe that it would be effective on a porous surface.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this strong enough to keep a tv from falling over if the tv stand it is on is being rocked\/shaken by a energetic toddler?\n Answer:","completion":" It is very sturdy, however if the stand itself can be rocked or shaken I would secure the stand as well. We have a very large tv on a stand close to the ground, our toddler can pull and shake on the TV and it holds well. I'm not sure I entirely understand your situation, but I hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this for a 65\" tv ?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have bought this product before, and would now like to buy just the \"sticky\" pads. Can you refer me to the right purchase option. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure about just the adhesive pads coming seperate. I checked the quakehold site and couldn't find anything. I would suggest contacting quakehold directly, or looking to see if the adhesive company 3M makes anything comparable. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the straps be attached to WALL with adhesive rather than screwed in?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes but it's better to screw it in for a stronger grip in my opinion.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these safety straps be screwed into the wall rather than the TV stand?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes Much better that way. Find stud locations and use lag bolts 1- 1\/2 long\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My TV is a 51 inch flat screen and sits in a corner on a glass tv stand. Is this a solution for me?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think so. You need to screw the base into something. Mine is on one of those Ikea \"wooden\" cabinets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the controls be read by someone who wears glasses or are they too small?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. My husband wears glasses and he has no problem seeing the controls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can an electrician install this or do you have to use Ge. This will be replacing a previous GE induction cooktop which lasted 15 years.\n Answer:","completion":" Same installation as the old one and does not have to be GE installing it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this downdraft ventilation?\n Answer:","completion":" No you will need desperate ventilation. However remember you don't have the open flame heat like a gas stove so less ventaltion is needed just to remove smoke or orders. I just have a microwave above with vent and it is perfect!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm replacing a 30\" JenAir glass cooktop and we have granite counters. I'm worried the cutout won't match exactly- what size will this require?\n Answer:","completion":" You can look up size requirements for opening on a G E help page. Oft hand the sizes are very close\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the stainless steel trim get scratched by the cookware (vs. a model without the trim)?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. We have had ours 9 months and have a small number of scratches. They are almost not noticeable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The electrical wires coming out of it do not look copper to me - they are silver in color. Does anyone know if these are copper or aluminium?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure but the electrician that installed it didn't have any issues with them or use any special connectors. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is it to clean? Does food get struck in between the cooktop and stainless steel trim?\n Answer:","completion":" It's very easy to clean. Just make sure you use the proper cleaner that's called out in the manual or you could scratch it. We love our stove top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My wife is concerned that she will break a glass top \/ smooth top cooktop. Is this a concern?\n Answer:","completion":" I also was very concerned as I had never owned a glasstop or induction either. After severall months of cooking on it I would not have a concern. Ijust removed anything I had around the stove so nothing would be dropped on it. Even the cookwear is heavier than most and no problems. I think this is the future cooktop and gas will be out! So fast and efficient even frying is easier and faster. If I would have know how wonderful it was, I would have purchased it years ago. Its the absolutely best change in my kitchen remodel. GO FOR IT!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much voltage is required. 120v or 220v?\n Answer:","completion":" 220V\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The stainless steel trim appears to be raised. Does this require extra care in positioning the cookware, or limit the size of the cookware bottom?\n Answer:","completion":" It is raised so your cookware cannot hang over the edge. We really haven't had any problems with this and we use large stockpots. If you use a large pot on one of the smaller cook surface you may have to set it off center a little which isn't an issue.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Seriously? I bought this exact same freezer for $189!\n Answer:","completion":" Home Depot stocks GE FCM5SUWW for $189: http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/GE-5-0-cu-ft-Chest-Freezer-in-White-FCM5SUWW\/203547584?cm_mmc=shopping-_-googleads-_-pla-_-203547584&skwcid&kwd=&ci_sku=203547584&ci_kw=&ci_gpa=pla&ci_src=17588969\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many maximum amps does this draw when the compressor is on.\n Answer:","completion":" The maximum start up amps would be 15 - according to the plug. Although it probably uses only 8 amps. When the compressor is running about 3-4 amps according to our electrician.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anybody kept this in their garage, if so, how did it hold up with regards to frost build up and keeping things frozen? I live in a warm climate.\n Answer:","completion":" I live in north carolina and have it in my garage and it is fine\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this a 110 or 220 plug?\n Answer:","completion":" 110. You have to actually wire it yourself as it doesn't ckme wired with a male plug.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these cooktops require 220 outlet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - but hard wired in a junction box, not a plug-in outlet. Install instructions specify a 208\/240 V power supply. However, they also say 40 amp and that would only be needed if you were using all burners at max heat at the same time. I had mine hooked up to the same 30 amp power supply as my old \"regular\" electric cooktop with no problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can an electrician install this or do you have to call GE?\n Answer:","completion":" My electrician was here to run an electric line to the island so he very quickly installed the cooktop. Be aware that this cooktop isn't a perfect square. If you already have a cut opening you may have to chalk the gaps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to get the candy mix up to a 310 degrees F. Will the new induction cooktop make things that hot?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely - candy was one of the first things I made on my cook top!!! (and needed to go to a hard crack stage.) It gets much hotter, also - if needed. I LOVE the \"H\" setting - brings water to a boil very rapidly. My one suggestion - get the 5 burner if your counter will in any way accommodate it. When we got our induction cook top, I'd never even seen one or knew anyone who had used it. My husband said, \"Get the 5 burner\" - I didn't want to, as I'd never been short on burners when cooking, even for groups. (I was always running out of oven space so we did get a double oven - reg. sized - LOVE it!) Well, even the sales person didn't explain to me the advantages of the 5 burner; it's more than just a burner. With induction, it is more important to match an sizes, but . .more importantly, you can only use \"H\" (the energy boost for rapid heating\" on one burner at a time in a section. On the 4-burner cooktop, there are 2 \"sections\" (I am sure there is a technical term for it) - on the 5 burner, there are 3 sections - so . . you can put more burners on \"H\" at the same time, and yep - I needed to one day when cooking for a crowd. Of course, you make do with what you have - but I sure wish I'd gone w\/the 5 burner for the times I need it. And . . I LOVE the \"L\" (lowest) setting - holds things perfectly, and I no longer need to melt choc. over a double boiler. I just put it in the pan on the stove -L setting. And .. I while many pans will work w\/induction, I'd recommend the best you can afford. We have been very frugal our entire lives - and did buy Demeyere pots and pans. LOVE them - (even when I had to cook on a coil hot plate while the kitchen was being remodeled.) Worth every penny - and if you get them at Sur LaTable and don't care for them you can return them. My husband loves them!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: i would like to put a drawer for spatulas, spoons, etc. under the cooktop and over the pot drawers--is that possible with this model?\n Answer:","completion":" The unit will \"stick down\" into the cabinet below the cook top about 6 inches. It is not possible to have a drawer in the \"normal\" position immediately under the unit. It is much the same as your kitchen sink in that regard. You could have a tip out drawer in front of the unit similar to the kitchen sink option, but that would not give you much storage space. hope this helps.\n"}

I am trying to decide between this &amp; kitchenaid that has the bridge feature.\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't tried that but why don't you call GE customer service and ask? Another Amazon customer had the same question. BTW I extensively reviewed quality price and cost before buying this unit for my new home and GE came out way on top in all categories on this unit. Amazon price was terrific, at the time I purchased it late 2013.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is my current 34 1\/2\" x 20 1\/4\" cut out too large to fit this unit?\n Answer:","completion":" The manual to this unit says the opening should be 37 1\/8 width and 19 1\/8 depth of cutout. They also say to use a 36\" base cabinete. I checked with my husband who measured and said that you would be very close. You have to put silicone around the unit from underneath and you may have a bit of an opening. The silicone may show from above a bit. He thinks that if you carefully position it, you should be able to go ahead and have the unit with the dimensions you've provided. I bought my unit online and there was a service number to call. I would go to retailmenot.com and find the least expensive price then I would call them and have them go over the dimensions so that you are absolutely certain. I can't stress enough what a wonderful cooktop this is. You will love it. I hope it works out for you. If you'd like I would be happy to either fax or mail you the installation page that gives all the diagrams and info. My email address is sedolgoff@aol.com\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How long is the power cord and which end of the unit does it originate from? (I'm trying to figure out if it will reach my nearest outlet. Thanks.)\n Answer:","completion":" Power cord is about 6 ft from the right side. Be careful of the supplier. Some are including GE in their ads but ship the Chinese brand. Also the handling is sometimes rough in shipping and the bottom of the packing is insufficient. If it is dropped on the power side the resulting dent will void your warrantee if you accept it. View the reports on the suppliers.\n"}

I bought the electric coil cartridge to switch out from the grilling cartridge, which we rarely used. I hope this is of some help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work on jenn air s100\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure how yours plugs in. On my stove where you plug the burner in there is a plug in, a hole, and another plug in. The burner JEA7000ADB has a plug, rod, half plug. I guess its that way so you could plug on either side of the stove. My stove is 25 years old and this burner fits just like the one that came with my stove. I hope that this is a help for you.\n"}

My griddle cartridge was broken and I replaced it with another coil cartridge. The electrical receptacles are the same for both the griddle cartridge and coil cartridge.

The front loaders harken back to the system the Indians used, beating them on a rock. We didn't feel they washed the clothes well. There was just a class action involving mold in front loaders. To my knowledge, we did not have that problem with this machine, which we avoided by removing standing water when we were done using it and by leaving the door wide open when not in use. I DO know my sister had a problem with hers though, with mold on the door gasket that WOULD NOT come out of the rubber, no matter WHAT I tried.

Not a technician, but at 67, been around the block a few times enough to garner experience. ;&lt;) 1. Is it a hard water accumulation (white powder) ? If so, soak in vinegar. 2. Is it possibly fabric strands (shouldn't, but could be) ? If so, try to remove the screens. You might try soaking them in bleach or drain cleaner (it's main ingredient is bleach). After removing the worst of it, you could then carefully (IF the screen is metal and there is no RUBBER gasket), hold the screen over a flame to burn off the rest. OR, you could spend a lot of time meticulously picking out whatever is left. All I can think of. Hope I've helped.\n"}

It shines. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I haven't had an ice maker, will this kit provide everything I need? Do I need to buy a waterline that will connect to the refrigerator separately?\n Answer:","completion":" The cover to the plug in the freezer where the ice maker connected had what type of ice maker would fit. Yes I had to buy a ice maker supply line kit from Home Depot. This kit had a saddle valve and 25ft of 1\/4\" supply line.

{"prompt":"Question: do i use tap water in the machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I have. I let the water run until I know its cold enough. Its been 2 yrs. since I have had mine. Knock on wood, mine is doing good, no problems or issues with it. It has paid for itself, since I don't have a ice maker on my apt. refrigerator. Forget ice cube trays, they don't make enough, take too long to freeze. I make around 3-4 gallon size freezer bags full of ice. This can take all day and into the evening to get nice full bags of ice. You can leave the ice maker if you have to leave to do something. I have, and when I get back its waiting for me to empty the ice and\/or add water. Doesn't overheat either, as it shuts down automatically.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: 1\/2 vs 3\/4 horse power\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure what your question is here. If you're asking whether you should go with 1\/2 or 3\/4 HP, I think the answer is \"it depends\". If you're in the habit of routinely loading up the disposer with all sorts of waste and expecting it to handle it, the 3\/4 HP or even 1 HP model is a better choice. On the other hand, you really should never load up a disposer like this and should not discard larger solids through the disposer anyway. The disposer itself may be able to handle large amounts of solid waste, but your drain pipes won't like it and you're very likely to have flow problems and\/or blockages over time if you use your disposer this way.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I install it myself?\n Answer:","completion":" In order to install the Waste King L-2600 you will have to possess basic plumbing skills. For my Kitchen sink all of the necessary parts were supplied to connect to the dish washer and the drain pipe from the sink. I supplied plumbers putty for installation to the bottom of the sink. I am accustom to doing most of my own repairs. Dave.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what about the dishwasher connection?\n Answer:","completion":" No problem,matched up perfectly with existing fittings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what type of power cord\n Answer:","completion":" Unit comes with own power cord to plug in to under sink power source\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: It works in a network 220 V? If isn't present, what model works in a network 220V?\n Answer:","completion":" The voltage is 110 AC on this model. Their line of commercial disposers would be 220 AC voltage. They also make a line of international disposers, if you are looking for a 22 DC model. They are sold under the names of Waste King and Sinkmaster. The Waste King models all start with the letters WKI. WKI-1001, WKI-2600, WKI-3300, WKI-8000, WKI-2600TC, WKI-5000TC, and WKI-8000TC.

Thats just an example, but you can also just keep funneling whatever it is down the disposal without the need to take breaks of feeding it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is battery life of the lr44?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure how long the battery lasts. I've had my Mini Hygrometer since last winter 2012. It still works just fine. It's perfect for fitting in small places. I keep it in my guitar case in the dry winter months to keep check on humidity. In humid summer months I keep it on night stand where it doesn't take up much space. I don't expect this digital unit being a small size will go through batteries very fast. Battery could last a year or two. Most important, this unit is very well made. Hope this helps, Stan\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used in a room you want to be used as a root cellar?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see why not. I use it in my guitar case. It is one of the smaller Thermometers, but one of the very best in quality built. I have had mine for a year or so now. Never had any problems with it. It's very convenient to use because of it's size. Stan\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this electric or battery powered?\n Answer:","completion":" it is battery powered and has a watch-type battery already installed. There's a red tape you pull out of the battery area after you open the box which allows the battery to make contact and it comes on. So no battery to buy. Seems to work pretty good, I use it in my basement to measure humidity.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of batteries does it use?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't remember the brand of my battery, (Possibly NL) but it is 1 small LR44 (0. o\/o Hg Cell) and has lasted me for over a year.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How fast does it change?\n Answer:","completion":" I have found that as the weather and temperature change - mine is fairly rapid to change - but then I do not have a second one in my case to compare it with to see if one is more rapid than the other, nor do I watch it on an hourly basis.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this unit self contained i.e., no external sensor wires?\n Answer:","completion":" It is self contained but, , , approximately 6 degrees off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How is this mounted? I want to use it on my motorcycle and mount it to the inside of the fairing. Can I use velcroe or two-sided tape?\n Answer:","completion":" Comes included but, , , is like 6 degrees off and no way too adjust it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this Whirlpool Dishwasher Latch Handle Assembly fit my amana model #ADB1500AWW\n Answer:","completion":" I do not believe this item will work with your dishwasher. I went to Amana.com - click Customer Service - click Replacement Parts - and put in the model number you have above. There are some variations, so you want to make sure that there are no additional digits that follow the WW on the manufacturer tag of your dishwasher. There is one that matches exactly (no digits after), so that is the one I used, and went to the \"control panel\" display. The Latch Assy called out is a 99003347. The one you were asking about is 99002577. Amazon does carry the one you need (99003347). Just go to their site and type in 99003347 and do a search, it should come up. There are some other items that come up also, but I didn't see that they were a match. I would stick with the exact number match. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with the amana model adb1500aws?\n Answer:","completion":" The only way to know for sure is to look at the product and see what models this latch is compatible with our call Amazon customer service.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work on my Maytag Dishwasher model MDBH980AWS1\n Answer:","completion":" I just entered my Maytag model #MDBH975AWS and this part came up for it. It fits perfectly and took my husband 5 minutes to put in. You can also watch installation on Youtube. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is W10130695 the correct latch for a Maytag MDBS561AWB1?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a Maytag MDB 8601 AWS and this latch worked just fine. I think the Maytag is made by Whirlpool.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have the assembly and the latch? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Yes this comes with handle\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the part I need for my Maytag dishwasher, model MDB4621AWS0?\n Answer:","completion":" I got it for a Maytag. It isn't the same model number as yours, but the part seemed pretty universal. It wasn't the same model # I needed either, but has worked great and was fairly easy for my husband to change.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: arrival time\n Answer:","completion":" Dear customer, Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately, we can not guarantee an arrival time once it leaves our location. However, we ship all of our received order in a 24 hour basis. Let us know if there is anything else we can help you with. Regards\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this latch assembly fit maytag Model #MDB6650AWW ?\n Answer:","completion":" I think the best way to answer your question is for you to remove the inside door cover to see if the picture matches the door latch you have. The one pictured is a pretty universal latch for the Maytag brand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should these be used with outlet covers or without? We have a home with standard receptacles and plastic covers that go into the slots now.\n Answer:","completion":" This one has plastic inside that is pushed aside by a plug, but when the plug is out it covers the two hot slots so it should prevent a child from getting shocked.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My first time buying outlets, if I get these will I need to know anything about the ones I'm replacing or are these sort-of universal?\n Answer:","completion":" As far as I'm aware you need to know if you want a 15 or 20amp outlet. My understanding is 15 amp is more common. Check that the unit is not close to a sink or any other water source as then you would need a different type of outlet. Otherwise I followed instructions from a YouTube video and found it very straight forward.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do these work? I have a new house full of them and I cannot plug in a 3 pronged plug into any of them.\n Answer:","completion":" when inserting a plug, make sure that both prongs go in at the same time. there is a plastic gate of sorts just inside the openings that need to be opened at the same time. this protects against insertion of items such as a paper clip or a butter knife into one side of the outlet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can the two sockets be wired separately? i am building a temperature control box and need to independently power two sockets\n Answer:","completion":" All the Duplex Recptacles I've ever seen, If you break off the \"Breakable\" metal tab between the connector screws, you can wire each outlet separately.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a 10 pack or single outlet?\n Answer:","completion":" Single outlet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I replace a two prong outlet with this one?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes watch what color you take wires off usually white screw goes to white wire and bronze screw goes with black wire\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How flexible is the duct? Is it possible to push it radially?\n Answer:","completion":" The duct is very flexible, but also very thin. I don't think it will take much abuse in the 'push it radially' department. But it will bend easily. I attached mine to a 90 degree elbow out the back of my dryer so it wouldn't crimp, bend, and close up. But if you are trying to attach it and move it laterally from the outlet (say left to right) I would say you'll be okay - as long as it's not too far, too quick. In other words, this is thin material we're talking about, not the heavier actual metal ducts you have have seen elsewhere. I worried about ti being so thin when I installed it, but it has held up just fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Thin\/flexible duct causes fires, death? Use semi-rigid instead?\n Answer:","completion":" I just purchased this based on the description that states \"UL 2158A Listed And Marked. Constructed of 4 ply aluminum foil laminate that will not support combustion.\" According to the article referenced below \"\"Only flexible ductwork meeting UL 2158A can be used as dryer venting.\" http:\/\/homerepair.about.com\/od\/heatingcoolingrepair\/ss\/dryerventsafety_2.htm\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you cut it easily to your need? I need about a foot.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, with sturdy shears, like kitchen shears or the plastic package,opening clippers\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you clean the duct?\n Answer:","completion":" I think a flexible duct is easier to replace than it would be to clean it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it fit on a 4 inch dryer vent? I purchased a similar looking product at Lowes and it just does not fit over the vent in the dryer.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, mine is a 4 inch vent and it fits perfectly\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Isn't this flammable?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Any chance this will hold up as the arms on a 4 year old's robot halloween costume?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it should, it's flexible.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you connect two together? The distance from the dryer to the vent is longer than 8 ft\n Answer:","completion":" I've found an article on the topic of dryer vent length: http:\/\/www.appliance411.com\/faq\/dryer-vent-length.shtml It seems flexible tubes aren't good for long distances and you should think about getting a rigid vent instead.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: so any way to remove this mold? just replace the rubber gasket\/lining? apparently not easy to re-insert...\n Answer:","completion":" Well the problem with any mold is that it's alive, more or less. So, once it starts, one either kills it or does not. What I did (no longer have that machine,) was always wipe the inside of the seal with a solution of pure liquid bleach, applied on a rag, using my finger tip (rubber gloves, OK) as the applicator. That more or less did the job... depending on how bad it was. But there's no doubt it's a troublesome problem. The other thing I frequently did was run a load of HOT water in the empty machine, with about a quart of pure bleach. I think you get the drift: mold is not your buddy; kill it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the pedestal designed to support the stackable washer\/dryer or only each unit separately unstacked?\n Answer:","completion":" Are you actually considering buying this thing? It is terrible. Do not do it. The only stacking that should happen is in a trash bin.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where do you put the bleach\n Answer:","completion":" It is the same place you put the soap but in one of the two compartments. It has raised writing (letters) which one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: lg 30\" convecion wall oven\n Answer:","completion":" Nancy, I did not get your question, but I have had this oven for over 3 years. I love it! It is the best oven I have ever had. The only thing I have found is when I clean it, the highest cleaning level is too much. I have to use the medium level of cleaning. Other than that this is the perfect oven. When I get a new stove, I will buy electrolux. I hope this helped you. Any other questions, please ask.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: problems with fans?\n Answer:","completion":" No problems with anything yet. Oven is about a year old.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the oven racks be removed and adjusted for baking large items\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, all racks and supports are removable. In fact, the user's manual states that the racks and supports are supposed to be removed prior to using the self-cleaning cycle. The racks just lift right off the supports. I removed mine and repositioned them a couple of times to get them where I wanted them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: May I know what is Org.?\n Answer:","completion":" Are you referring to something on the oven? Perhaps it means original?? I could not find this term Org. on the Amazon info or my oven. Sorry\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: any problems with this oven so far??\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Every time we've run the self-clean cycle it burned out the thermostat and the oven stops working. Both techs told us this was not an uncommon problem - just don't use the self-clean cycle. Other than that we love it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone purchased this oven recently?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes,but still in the box\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many bottles of wine can it hold?\n Answer:","completion":" It hold 6 on the bottom rack - this picture is incorrect. The top 2 racks are glass shelves most likely used for bottles & canned beverages, but I suppose you could also have wine bottle on their side there. Google the model number and you will see the correct picture on the Electrolux website.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much height do you have for the top two shelves? Can you fit beer or gatorade bottles in both spaces, or does the lower shelf have less space?\n Answer:","completion":" I am using mine as a pure beverage center (sodas, waters, juices, beers), as I have a separate dual zone cooler just for wine only. As such, I removed the bottom wine rack. I was able to position the top rack so that beers up to long neck bottles (e.g., Coronas) fit just fine with about an additional 3\/4\" height clearance, then the middle rack positioned below with enough space for the small (10 oz.) size of canned sodas, then plenty of height on the bottom floor of the unit to again easily load tall neck beer bottles. Note that the bottom floor section of the fridge stays approximately 7 degrees warmer than the upper two shelves, so I use the bottom shelf mostly for bottled waters and overflow beers from the top shelf (drink from the top shelf, quick restock from the bottom shelf to the top). Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this hold champagne bottles?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, we often put prosecco or champagne bottles on the bottom rack and the middle you can lay down whatever you want\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the shelf heights adjustable for this unit? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" No, the height is not adjustable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the wine rack removable? Could it be removed and then more cans\/bottles be stored in its place?\n Answer:","completion":" I think so. Not 100% positive. The way mine is installed the door does not open all the way So there is not enough room to get the rack out but it does look like it will slide out with the door fully opened.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this be used to hold only cans of soda or is the wine rack a permanent feature?\n Answer:","completion":" The wine rack can be easily removed. There are also 2 adjustable, slide out glass shelves - so a number of configurations are possible.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I either choose or change which side the door opens from?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, you can change the side the door opens from, but it requires ordering an additional part from the company. Kind of a pesky issue considering the cost of the fridge. Other than this the fridge is wonderful.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My heigh clearance is 35.5\". Are there leg pegs on the bottom of the fridge I can remove? Or is this fridge really 34\" height as specified?\n Answer:","completion":" It has some screw like legs that help you gain height if you extend them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the refrigerator lock?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it does not\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you pull the shelves out to customize space in the unit for say a gallon of milk?\n Answer:","completion":" Both shelves pull out but they're not tall enough for a gallon of milk. But the pull out function is great for locating bottles\/cans.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: HOW IS IT INSTALLED\n Answer:","completion":" The sensor end goes in your fridge\/freezer. The sensor has about 2' of cord. You close the door on the cord. The display comes with sticky velcro pads so you can stick it anywhere on the fridge (most likely on top or on the side). I used a glue gun to affix the sensor and cord so that they would stay put (the suction cup does not stay on). You may need to adjust the location of the sensor in order to get the reading you desire as it can vary depending on how close it is to cold blowing air, the door jam and also the height. For my upright units, I found that a location towards top, halfway towards the back of the unit gave me the most consistent readings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this NIST certified? Can it be used to monitor vaccine temperatures?\n Answer:","completion":" I have no idea if it's NIST certified, but having bought and owned one of these, I wouldn't trust it monitoring turkeys I bought on sale, never mind vaccines... this thing is junk... save your money and buy something better....\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this alert me if the temp drops below a specific mark? I want to use it in my house to alert me when I'm sleeping and if the heat is not working.\n Answer:","completion":" I have never seen a way to set the alarm temp besides choosing between fridge and freezer and I have several of these in use. I also find the quality control to be poor as the last two I bought didn't function at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the alarm temperature setting adjustable?\n Answer:","completion":" No. This unit is sold under several different names. If you find my review of \"CDN Audio Visual Refrigerator Freezer Alarm\" I have detailed the unit's operation and provided pictures that show the temp range stamped on unit case.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Loyal WMS4-C000674 Braided 3\/8-Inch Washing Machine Connector, Stainless Steel. $6.21 Is this sold as ONE hose or TWO hoses? Is it a set? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" This is sold as ONE. I had to re-order for the second hose. I would definitely change the hot water side first.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the country of origin?\n Answer:","completion":" China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will they fit a Kenmore washer?\n Answer:","completion":" yeah. it should fit any washer. those connectors are pretty standard.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are these hoses lead free?\n Answer:","completion":" There is a large \"LEAD FREE\" tag on them. Along with a separate tag with CSA and NSF endorsements.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long have you had your hoses and have you experienced any leaks or leaking fittings?\n Answer:","completion":" No leaks and the fittings are perfect. I've moved the washing machine multiple times with the hoses attached with no ill effects. These are great hoses.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: these are used for hot and cold water coming into the washer - what do I need for water being pumped out of washer? thanks in advance\n Answer:","completion":" You will need a drain hose. There are universal drain hoses and specific brand and\/or models drain hoses you can search for. They also come in difference lengths.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: when I was turning off the water by turning clock wise water started to drip out is that normal? thanks in advance\n Answer:","completion":" If there is no drip when the water is on, but it started dripping when you were turning off the water, you need to replace the faucet. Feel for wetness with your fingers to find out where the water is coming from- if it is above where the hose connects, which in this case it most likely is, the faucet needs to be replaced, or at least new gaskets installed- I'd replace the faucet if that is the case. If that is dry, but is wet only at or below where you've attached the hose to the faucet, then the hose connector is where the leak is occurring. In this case, you probably will only need to replace a 25 cent rubber washer. Dry everything with paper towel or rag before checking where the leak I coming from. Plumbers tape is not an option- your seal is the rubber washer between the hose and the faucet, always check to make sure the rubber washers are in place. Hope this helps...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the connectors 3\/8 \" or 3\/4\" heading says 3\/8 and description says 3\/4. opening of faucet mouth is 3\/4+brass=3\/8, these what i need?\n Answer:","completion":" Standard washing machines have 3\/4\" supply line fittings on both ends of the hoses. These hoses are for a standard installation and have the 3\/4\" fittings.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I need freezer to just keep ice bags in that?\n Answer:","completion":" Why would you just use it for ice bags?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the right temperature setting for an upright frost free freezer (Frigidaire)\n Answer:","completion":" To maintain the proper temperature setting in your freezer you need a freezer thermometer. They are cheap and available in almost any kitchenware department. You can then choose whatever freezer setting that keeps the already frozen food at 0 degrees. If you are freezing any quantity of food you should bring your freezer temp to at least -10 degrees. Once your food is completely frozen you can reduce your setting to maintain the 0 degree temperature. Check your thermometer and set your freezer temperature setting accordingly. The fuller your freezer, the better it will hold the temperature and run more economically.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can the freezer door be reversed to open the opposite direction?\n Answer:","completion":" Off the top of my head I would say no. It has a lock installed on the left side of the door which could not be moved. It also has the digital temperature control and warning signal installed in the door just above the handle on the left side. Due to both of these issues I would say it must open on the left side. I also just looked through the manual and there are no instructions for making it a right opening freezer. I wonder if you might be able to special order it that way?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this freezer be used in a commercial kitchen? I live in Columbus Ohio\n Answer:","completion":" It is labeled as commercial, I don't believe it is reliable enough that I would trust it in a commercial setting. I had two compressors go so far. We caught it in time we lost about $20 worth of ice cream. The meat stayed frozen.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this work with a Honeywell TM005X Wireless Indoor\/Outdoor Thermo-Hygrometer (Old Version)\n Answer:","completion":" You shouldn't be sorry to use them. I have 3 and find that they work great. On occasion the signal may be lost on a particular sensor. If that happens then I just go manually thru the channels and then press the search button on the Master to bring it back online. Also, you will have an indicator on each channel which will tell you if a battery needs to be replaced on a particular sensor. So yes, they work and work very well to tell you temperature and humidity anywhere you place them as long as they can get an unobstructed signal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this compatible with the Meade \/ Honeywell TE923W ?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry Deborah I never tried it against another unit. Are they Honeywell units?

{"prompt":"Question: how do you add water\n Answer:","completion":" Easy. Open the lid. Lift out the basket and the water goes in the well under the basket. There is a fill line also when you are done if you are not going to use it for a few days there is a drain spout. I just set it over my sink and let it drain and wipe it out. It's ready the next time you need it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it possible to safely make ice without the small clear plastic gasket in the drain opening? Or will it leak all over?\n Answer:","completion":" yes,,, we have use this for 2 years now,,almost on all the time.... love the machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need heavy duty for about 50 people which do I need\n Answer:","completion":" Three people use this around the clock and it has yet to run out of ice. 50 people might be a stretch for this machine.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit make the small \"nugget\" ice--like you would find at a hospital?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How small is the ice on the smallest setting? Is it comparable to Sonic ice?\n Answer:","completion":" It's about twice that size but it's soft like Sonic ice if that makes sense. It's dome shaped ice. You can definitions chomp on it.... That's what got me hooked on this machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the hazmat code for this device? I need to ship it to Tortola.\n Answer:","completion":" Have no Idea. Quick search of manufacture site yielded no results. Ask the manufacture would be your best option to get that answer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many watts?\n Answer:","completion":" I measured it on my kilowatt meter, its 120 watts max when its running and making ice. It'll run off a car inverter NO problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the cubes clear or cloudy?\n Answer:","completion":" They are opaque in color\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it serve crushed ice?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I purchase extra plastic stops for the drain, I have a fear that it can get lost very easy. if yes how and where\n Answer:","completion":" I have had my machine 4 years. I take the filter (located in lower left of water bin-in the hole that takes in water) out on a regular basis and clean it. If I forget about it the machine will show ADD WATER LIGHT when there is plenty of water in the bin and the filter is too clogged to suck in water. I take a butter knife and pop it out of the center of the hole. I do not know where or if you can buy replacements but I still use the original that came with my machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How loud is this ice maker?\n Answer:","completion":" If there's nothing else on ie T.V., radio etc. You can hear it especially at night. Also it stopped working after two years. Can't seem to find anyone to fix it. ...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this hook up to a water cooler?\n Answer:","completion":" No it will not, you need to manually fill lt.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it 12 volt\n Answer:","completion":" No, you must have access to an electrical outlet\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of filter does this have in it.\n Answer:","completion":" It does not have a filter in it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what kind of warranty does this ice maker come with?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe it was a 1 yr warranty. Ours lasted just several months after our warranty was up. If I were you I would look for a better one. A friend of mine bought the same one, and his broke down too. Save your money on this and look for a better deal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the ice like the soft bullet ice that you find at some restaurants? It crushes so easily like it has air in it? Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" No..it is not like soft bullet..it does not crush easily but as like normal ice cube.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much is the size difference between small and large cubes? I got a machine yesterday, and there doesn't seem to be much difference in size.\n Answer:","completion":" Hey Bradley, there is quite a difference in the size... I have found that the difference in the \"melt time\" is even bigger than the appearance. It takes a couple cycles for the large size to freeze to its max size, especially here in Florida unless I have the air conditioner very cold inside which I dont like.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It says it produces a \"batch\" of ice in 15 minutes. How many cubes is that (medium size)?\n Answer:","completion":" I get 9 Large cubes in 15 mins. or less. Hope this helps. Awesome ice maker.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what the difference between waeco and dometic?\n Answer:","completion":" Nothing they are the same. I would not buy either one I had two of them and they were not very well made and very hard to get parts for. The first one I bought I had to take back three times to get one that worked properly. I would recommend an Engel cooler never had a bit of trouble with the two that I bought. Vaughn\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Dryer heats but wont turn off just keep running. Not sure what part I need thermostat?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Sounds like the timer switch. More expensive. The 2 thermostats control the heat and extreme temps. The timer on an older dryer is the main knob that you turn to select what type of load you have and how much time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need a thermostat for a kenmore electric dryer model 96575100 do u have this\n Answer:","completion":" Hi , You need part # 279816 it is a little different than this one chosen\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are the shelves spaced wide enough apart that cake layers could be cooked on the rack?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come in its own box? I'd like to give it as a gift and want it to look new (rather than presenting it in an Amazon box).\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I've purchased two sets, each at separate times and they came in nice retail boxes, which I kept for storing the racks in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this hold half sheet commercial pans?\n Answer:","completion":" The best answer anyone can give you is to check the measurements of the rack against the measurements of your pans. I don't use mine that way, but IIRC the half sheets are too big, I think it will only hold the quarter sheets, but don't take my word for it. Measure, measure, measure. Seriously. There is one bad review here written by someone who didn't measure and blamed the product when their pans didn't fit. Also note that the rack has to be oriented in one direction, front-to-back -- there are posts on the sides to keep things from sliding out. So, if your pan is too long to fit in your oven that way, and I'm betting it is, it's not going to work with this rack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the height of the racks adjustable?\n Answer:","completion":" No.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it sit on the floor of the oven or does it need a rack?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it will be too close to the element. I always put my oven rack at the lowest position & then put the 3-in-1 rack on top of the oven rack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this rack come with the individual cookie sheets for each layer? Are they attached?\n Answer:","completion":" They do not come with the cookie sheets. Only 1 rack is attached to the sides which unfold. The other 2 hook on to the sides.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you remove any of the racks?\n Answer:","completion":" No, they are all attached to each other. They do however, come limetedly apart from each other enough to swing the layers to fold flat for storage.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will a 15 1\/4 by 10 1\/4 inch cookie sheet fit on all three levels, since I have to buy new ones to use this?\n Answer:","completion":" Since the levels measure 15.5 x 14.2, if the sheet fits on one, it should fit on all three, as shown in the image provided. But do note the support uprights at the sides. You can only slide sheets or pans in from the front.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the bigest size you carry ?\n Answer:","completion":" There is only on size.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the Dual Fuel the better option?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. We have natural gas. No option in our area for dual fuel. Stove is second to none. B.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How to clean the oven\n Answer:","completion":" I have since moved to a new city and left the Bertazzoni behind, so I cannot recall exactly how it is cleaned...but my memory is telling me that it's non-self-cleaning, so you've got to do it the old fashioned way. I'd recommend looking up the particular range you have in mind on the Bertazzoni site (just Google \"Bertazzoni manual\" and you should be able to find a PDF and figure it out. :-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you set oven temperture ?\n Answer:","completion":" Which stove do you have?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it hold professional sized cookie sheets?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Black burner crates are made of what material? Are they black enamel?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. They look to be cast iron, not enamel. As my review indicates, we have had some trouble with this, particularly with technical support. The burners don't always light and stay lit. The oven is great but the fan can stay on forever after cooking at high temps. Sometimes I have to flip the breaker to turn it off. On the plus side, it looks great and is easy to clean.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this plug into a regular outlet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the washer does fit a regular outlet and please review the owners manual\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Dimensions of this machine\n Answer:","completion":" 23.25\" deep, 33.25\"high,23.5\" wide. With door open 39\" deep plus need 5.5\" clearance at back. Fits under counter\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it come with wheels portable?\n Answer:","completion":" no\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do I clear the filter on the front load whirlpool washer?\n Answer:","completion":" Carefully pop off the lower front panel (it may be hard to do--carefully using a screw-driver will help). Then unscrew the plug in the lower rt hand corner. Have lots of towels spread out, as there will be a lot of water coming out once you do that.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with Whirlpool WGD70HEBW 1?\n Answer:","completion":" Andrea, you would be better off to order the Maytag conversion kit for your model. You need w10307153 conversion kit for the model you have. You can find it at this link (http:\/\/www.ajmadison.com\/cgi-bin\/ajmadison\/W10307153.html) . Price is 20.00. Tom\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this compatible with WGD8800YC?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not a Whirlpool repairman but Whirlpool is probably using the same valve assemblies as older models so this conversion kit has a high chance of success.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it work on glass cooktop ? I want to know from the manufacturer not just some one who thinks so\n Answer:","completion":" I recently purchased a new, ceramic glass cooktop range. In the literature that came with the stove this Griddle was advertised. The model number corresponds with the Whirlpool model shown here (4396096RB). The description specifically advertises that it works on ceramic glass cooktops: \"Commercial-grade, cast-aluminum surface safe for use on gas and electric ceramic glass cooktops and ranges to expand cooking surface.\" This is straight from the manufacturer. Hope that helps! (I plan on ordering one)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would 4396096rbc griddle be compatible with my flat top electric stove #D41717691?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes I have an electric range it works great\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this sit on top of the existing \"grill\" of my gas range or do you take the existing grill off and set it in its place? Does this have legs?\n Answer:","completion":" We have a gas fired cooktop. We place the griddle on the grates right over the burners. There are no legs. My wife's comment is \"I love that thing\". It is somewhat heavy so you have to consider where you will store it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a glass top but not with the extended burners. Since it's so long, will it work using 2 separated burners together?\n Answer:","completion":" yes I typically set the smaller burner a little hotter The griddle is thick and heavy so it takes some time to heat up - be careful and dont set the temp too high if you get impatient - once its TOO hot then it takes a long ti8me to cool to Just set the temp that it should be and give it about 4-6 min to heat up\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use it inside an oven?\n Answer:","completion":" I would not think so. Why would you want to? It's a stovetop griddle.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it work as a replacement for Maytag Model CDE852 Jenn Air electric range? Approximate open size of hole is 18 \/2 X 10\"\n Answer:","completion":" This is a big rectangle piece of metal that can sit on any flat surface. You can put on a barbeque grill or lay it on the coals. Your electric range top will have no problem with the grill unless your top is too small.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work on an older gas range?\n Answer:","completion":" That would depend upon the dimensions of your burner grates, but having had a couple of gas ranges in then past I don't know why not. I can't say for sure, however.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this fit on the 5 burner whirlpool gas range\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure which one you have but I use it on my KitchenAid KFGS366VSS 36\" 5 burner. It fits perfectly over the two right-most burners and works great. Only catch for me is I have a KA \"snorkel\" downdraft vent at the back of the cooktop and I have to make sure the griddle is clear of it before turning on the vent fan.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is made?\n Answer:","completion":" Wisconsin. Works great. I love it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the diamentions of it?\n Answer:","completion":" Roughly 19 1\/2 by 10 3\/4 fits perfectly over the two burner\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the water travel through plastic? What is on the inner part that touches the water? I wonder if copper is better.\n Answer:","completion":" It is a rubber core. I have it running between the filter and the fridge. The copper I had got a kink in it so I went with stainless. The stainless made the water intermittently taste terrible. I have had this for a few months now. No problems and the (well) water always tastes good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you couple two hoses together to make one? need a longer length\n Answer:","completion":" One would need a male coupler as the houses have female ends.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have a .25 Inch Fitting?\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the size of this product?\n Answer:","completion":" I searched the Whirlpool site for this product but it doesn't specify. It is a generic hose to fit all ice makers...so that means 1\/4\" x 1\/4\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 1\/4 by 1\/4\n Answer:","completion":" Yes....1\/4\" x 1\/4\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this hose lead free?\n Answer:","completion":" to be sure, I dont know, but it is a top quality hook-up hose. I dont think it is, or they could not sell it as a ice maker line\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I buy this two pack, will I also need a drain hose?\n Answer:","completion":" A washer comes with a drain hose attached but not the hot\/cold water hoses..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit my WFW86HEBWH Whirlpool washer?\n Answer:","completion":" I suspect it would. It's a standard hose for a clothes washer. Unless your washer is very new and has a fancy hookup that I've never experienced. I've got it attached to a 2001 Maytag\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the diameter??\n Answer:","completion":" Generally the same all-over as your typical US garden hose and USA-standard GHT (\"Garden Hose Thread\") metal fittings at the end, which have a 1\"1&#8260;16 outer diameter on the threads. The \"L\" turn is the smallest diameter point because it comes from the inside diameter of the hose.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this hose work for a steam dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I have a steam dryer and these hoses are great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these hose made in the USA\n Answer:","completion":" I checked the entire package and it does not say exactly where it was manufactured, but for the 5 year warranty replacement you send them back to Bremen Indiana. They are of very good quality.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used for refrigerator ice maker\n Answer:","completion":" The supply lines for a washer are the same size and fittings as one's garden hose. Also, a washer requires two lines: one for hot and another for cold water. A refrigerator ice maker requires a single 1\/4\" copper or plastic line. Also, the fitting at the refrigerator requires a different type of connection. Go to Lowes or Home Depot and buy a specific kit for an ice makert. While there you can compare it to washer supply lines and the difference will be obvious.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it automatically stop leak?\n Answer:","completion":" No, they are just regular hoses, just better quality.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this vent fit an electric 3.4 Cubit ft. whirlpool dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" This will fit any dryer that has a (standard) 4\" diameter vent pipe.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used with a gas dryer. Thank You\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Absolutely.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you just cut this in half with tin snips and slide part of it back over itself and then tape it?\n Answer:","completion":" No cutting. It is already in two pieces. It slides up and down and slide it apart for what ever length you need. My husband is a contractor and said it does not need taped if you don't want to tape it. Fits tight. Hope this answered your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this 18\" from the center of each opening to the other? Or 18\" from the very end of the \"box\" to the other end of the \"box\"? I need to reach 17\" from the exact center of each opening.\n Answer:","completion":" If you look at the layout of the pipe, it should be 18-20\" Center to Center and 24\" overall. This is per site: partselect.com and type in the model number. The grid is 1\" squares.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The photo doesn't show the other side -- can I slide one of the vent holes to fit a 12\" space between holes?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. You just have to trim the excess with tin snips. Seal the whole thing with aluminum tape before placing the two sides. It says 0-18\" because you can slide the two closer together but it doesn't mention the trimming involved. Mine works great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the max length of 18\" measured from center of duct output to center of duct input or elsewhere?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I do believe that it is center to center. I would double check, but it is installed and a little bit of a pain to take out and replace.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the minimum dimension it can be shrunk to? I need it to span between 5-9 inches.\n Answer:","completion":" 0-18. You should be fine\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit on a Kenmore gas dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sure it will. Mine is a Whirlpool, but I believe the holes are all standard size.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have about 41\/2\" clearance. How much of this will the unit take up?\n Answer:","completion":" It will work - but not much extra space - depends how much of the connector pipe - the round opening you need to make a good connection with your vent in the wall - 3.5 inches total is a minimum - and 4 makes it a little easier to use. There are not many more options - it is worth a try\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this periscope be long enough for Whirlpool washer model no.WTW4800XQ 27\" measuring from the center vent? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" I am using this on a Maytag with a center vent. I had to trim the unit down to fit the needed 18 inches of space to cover. Once you trim the unit, I recommend using aluminum tape to seal the edges and side seams. Since I have installed this device, I have had no issues with my dryer taking too long to dry clothes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How to Calibrate??? Does anyone know if this can be calibrated ? 'Removed board; no means of setting temp.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think you can. My Temp is off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you set the time? at first the time was accurate and now I can't reset\/fix it.\n Answer:","completion":" When it's showing the time (not alarm time), press and hold \"Mode\" button. Now you can adjust time with \"ADJ\" button and move between time parameters with \"Mode\" button.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you set it to display degrees F ??? mine does not have any push switches under the stand\n Answer:","completion":" Mine has a button on the back under one of the legs of the stand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you turn off the alarm?\n Answer:","completion":" There is a little black button beside the battery compartment, behind the stand. I think I had that problem once and hit it by mistake probably trying to take the battery out to stop the alarm, but then found it in the directions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a back light? What is the warranty?\n Answer:","completion":" There isn't a back light. The display is large and easy to read in dim light. There is no mention of a warranty in the instruction sheet that came with the unit.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How to Calibrate??? Does anyone know if this can be calibrated and how ? No adjustments found on circuit board.\n Answer:","completion":" I was wondering the same thing. i bought FIVE of them, and they are all different. For example temp 72 72.5 73 72.8 or 74.2 similar within 8% on humidity, which to me is quite a difference. I let them sit in the same room for five days and they did get a little closer, within 5% of each other.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size is it?\n Answer:","completion":" It is about 3 inchs by 4 inchs. with a depth of about half an inch. My clock doesn't keep time...The hours jumps all over the place. i dont recommend this unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size ice does it make? I'm looking for one that makes small (like Sonic) ice. Maybe slightly bigger.\n Answer:","completion":" There are two sizes it makes. The largest one is probably no more than 1\/2 to 3\/4 of an inch in length. Each cube has a opening at one end and is hollow. The cubes are more like hardened slush than regular ice cubes and do not last very long in a room temperature or even chilled liquid. The other end is rounded as are the sides except for the opening side which is flat. The holding basket for cubes made is directly over the water level compartment so the cubes are very watery and start to melt if not removed immediately. The basket in the water holding compartment directly under the door lid on top of the unit is not cooled except by the cubes that are made and put into the basket by the device. Taking the cubes out of the device and putting them in our freezer as they are made is a small task, but once in the freezer each individual cube freezes solid and to each other also due to their watery condition so you have to use a tool or pick to separate them from each other and any others that were already in the ice cube container in the freezer. I did not find any other brand that was very much better except very large devices used mostly by dinning places. This device works, but don't expect regular frozen cubes nor the ease of storing them very long as a normal freezer would store them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do I need to shut off ice machine to empty ice basket? Instructions do not say\n Answer:","completion":" No you don't. If it produces ice while out, the ice will just go down in the water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the size of the ice-maker?\n Answer:","completion":" Its about 14\" tall x 24\" deep x 12 \" wide. It doesn't take up a lot of counter space but its amazing how quickly it makes ice and how much it makes. I highly recommend this item. If mine dies, I'm getting another one!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Not enough characters for me to ask question - I've cleaned with hot soapy water and used disinfectant - which does work, but could I use vinegar...\n Answer:","completion":" I'm guessing that it has a \"funny\" taste when you fired it up the first time? If so, it's because you didn't let it sit for 24 hours after you took it out of the box. During transit, if it's turned upside down or on it's side, the gear oils run everywhere. Letting it sit for twenty-four hours before starting keeps it from tasting awful. Otherwise, I use vinegar to clean mine out once a month. And I only use filtered water to make ice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is a scooper included?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this really 12 volt\n Answer:","completion":" I will not recommend this ice maker. Extremely loud and broke after 7 months\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Not working\n Answer:","completion":" If out of warranty I would chunk it, else return for repair or replacement. These are great machines when they work. Clean water in, clean ice out. Would recommend buying extended warranty on these type ice makers. Our Koldfront was purchased as a spare for our SP brand which looks the same. However after going thru 4 SP brand units, each with a different failure in about 8 months, they issued a full refund. Today our 2nd Koldfront has failed after less than 6 months of use. Does not fill tray therefore makes very small ice. Will update later.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you get it fixed?\n Answer:","completion":" You don't ! Throw it in the trash and give this piece of crap company a bad rating.

{"prompt":"Question: does it come with damper for backdraft and bird mesh\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does. The damper is light and is wide open on my low setting and shuts perfectly. The only thing which took some time for me to get used to is the sound of rain drops hitting it are pretty loud! Maybe because It is only about a foot from the intake to the top.\n"}

The Broan 634M does have a round collar and I believe it is 6\" in diameter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I continue to have an ice or water puddle under the wide drawer in the refrigerator portion. Why is water pooling under deli drawer in refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" there are two things. both are easy fixes and one fix is easier than the other. first, open your fridge drawers and see if they kindve come back. if they dont at all, then your problem is that the unit is too level. just get a pair of pliers or a wrench the correct size and twist the front feet of the unit higher than the back. if the doors swing back, then the unit can drain properly. if that isnt the case, then you have to clean two tubes found behind the unit. if you take off the large plate on the back of the unit, you'll find two white rubber tubes. make sure the fridge is unplugged for this. take those tubes and any assembly pieces out and wash them with hot soapy water. rinse them well. allow them to dry and reinsert them. those things clog every couple of years if there is a lot of sediment in your water. we have had to do both. we've had our fridge three and a half years and still love it. little maintenance, but overall nice. there is no drain cup to dump, and other than replacing the water filter every six months, it is pretty maintenance free. just make sure the front is higher than the back and clean your tubes every couple of years--esp if you have hard water in your area.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is (front) height when fully loaded with 12 cans? Shelf to top of can?\n Answer:","completion":" My frig shelf spacing is 7 1\/4\" top of lower shelf to bottom of upper. With Coke cans it works perfect with no room to spare. Coors cans don't fit, too tall to load. Don't know about Bud, Pepsi or 7Up, all cans are different, Coke fits and works perfect. I've learned it's faster and easier to pull it out for reload. I bought this one for it's low profile and high reviews, personally I don't think you'll find one better.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you stack these on top of each other. So if I bought 2 could I have them 2 high instead of 2 wide?\n Answer:","completion":" I guess you could try to rig it in some way, but based on the wire frame setup, I would not recommend it. I don't think there's a great way to stack them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could you use this for vegetable cans instead of soda... would the veggie cans fit properly?\n Answer:","completion":" No, you can't.

{"prompt":"Question: does the top row of soda fall down to the bottom row when a can is taken out? or do both row roll forward separately?\n Answer:","completion":" The top row rolls onto the bottom roll when a can is taken out. You only take the can out of the bottom row.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how deep is this rack? my frig is smaller and I need one that is about 14\" deep\n Answer:","completion":" Unfortunately it's a bit over 16 inches deep.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The reviews are so varying. Is this product working correctly????\n Answer:","completion":" I think the key is where you hand the outside monitor. If you hang it leaning against a surface (especially glass, vinyl siding, or anything metal), sunlight heating the area touching the monitor will affect the reading, usually causing an abnormal high reading. If you hang it free haning in windy, cool, shady place it will read cool. Always keep in mind that the monitor is accurately reflecting the temperature of it's immediate environment and not simply the outside temperature.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: why such divergent reviews???\n Answer:","completion":" It works well for us. Hubby insalled it homself, and frankly he isn't as talented as he thinks when it comes to household repair. It's still going strong with minimal noise. I would recommend it. I don't know what others are saying about the disposal, but as a picky kinda cranky virgo perfectionist I have no complaints about it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the unit is jammed, resetting it does't help, how do you remove the object jamming it.\n Answer:","completion":" Disconnect the power source. Remove the sink insert and shine a flash light inside the unit. You should be able to sight the item that is jamming up your unit. Pu your hand inside if it is small enough and the power is disconnected and remove the item. If your hand will not fit you will have to improvised with a tool that will work to remove the item. I hope that this will assist you.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with a cover, so this side of sink can be used as a washer?

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit matag MAV3905 AWW? THE ORIGINAL PART # FOR MINE IS AP4373022\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see why it won't. You may have to do some minor modification (drill new holes in bottom of washer or snip a piece of metal off the housing--doubt it though) that's honestly pretty easy though. Mines still working like a champ! And for the price can't beat it! Also I'd have some help you hold the washer while its tilted forward.\n"}

SEARSPARTSDIRECT says your refrigerator is a \"side-by-side\" and also says \"No\". From the picture they provide it looks like your filter has two attachment points (\"nipples\"?) where the PUR you're asking about only has one.

{"prompt":"Question: This won't work if my old \"fastfill\" filter has 2 connectors, right? Just want to be sure since can''t return it. thx\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure about your old one and the toe connectors. This one only has one end with a little gasket on it.

{"prompt":"Question: Which one is this?\n Answer:","completion":" There are two models: Part 4396710 should not be used with refridgerators with \"Fast Fill\" or \"PUR Measure\" dispensers. If your fridge has these features you should purchase filter 4396841. And the only difference is that if you use the wrong filter, water might flow out slower than what you are used to. Not a big deal! The ONLY difference between those two filters is what model is appropriate for your fridge, otherwise the actual filtration quality between the two is the same.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: t1rfkb1\n Answer:","completion":" This Whirlpool water filter is the best water filter available for Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerators with push button base grill access.

After replacing all three parts, dryer works.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: purpose of thermo fuse\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. This is the component that regulates your dryer's temperature. If the temperature gets too high (possible restricted vent, too much lint, etc.) the thermo fuse burns open thus stopping electrical current and the dryer.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: can this be used on inglis led4400vq1 dryer\n Answer:","completion":" This is a Whirlpool\/Sears product. I would suggest that if your dryer does not product heat and the coils are broken or damaged; you should google your model number looking for a parts listing. When you see the element they should provide a drawing of the various parts in this assembly. From what I have seen these are much a standard part. You might want to try this trick, if this is the only part you need to replace. This is some type of fuse to keep your dryer from overheating. Take it out and if you can test the leads, if you can. If not the top should be flat and yours may now be more domned. If this is the case throw in on a concrete floor three or four times. This causes the dome to flatten and if you did measure the ohms should see a change from negative to positive. Bottom line no need to replace this part, if this is all that is wrong.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It seems that i need a thermostat and thermal limiter for kenmore compac dryer. The Sears part numbers are 3398128 and 343607. Same as yours?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know, but you can usually cross reference to an FSP part number. They make most if the piece parts anyway.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this thermostat be the cause of the timer not advancing ?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, if you are using an auto-dry cycle, such as Whirlpool's Miser-dry cycle as in the auto dry cycle when this thermostat cycles off, the power is redirected to the timer motor to advance the timer to the off position. There is no power to the timer motor until the thermostat cycles the heat off and then that power is directed to the timer motor. If your timer will not advance in timed and auto dry probably you have a bad timer or wire. If your timer will not advance in AUTO dry but will advance in timed dryer...problem is normally not your timer and in that case most likely this thermostat needs to be replaced, see: http:\/\/www.theapplianceclinic.com\/autodry.html\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many dead bodies can I store in this thing?\n Answer:","completion":" Well I suppose it would depend on how you processed them. I would say 2 average size corpses whole, folded in half of course. If you quartered them you could probably up that to 4 as it would be easier to arrange. If you ground them up, like with a wood chipper or perhaps a Vita-mix, you could probably do 7 depending on how you packaged it. Which brings up an interesting point this product has 2 baskets and 1fixed devider but it could use more division. I am going to do something with possibly plywood to give me more seperation for meats, vegetables, meals ready to cook, etc...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this energy star rated?\n Answer:","completion":" Just like the other customer stated, I do not see a star rating either. But I have had mines since July 11, 2013; and I have not noticed an increase in my monthly electric bill. I followed the directions for setting the temperature; before adding any food; and have not touched the setting since. I have been really pleased with my freezer. I have mines in my car garage\/basement, and the temperature in the summer, which was not very humid, did not appear to affect the freezer. The directions stated the basement is not recommended if your basement gets very humid. It runs quietly. The size is just right for me and my daughter to store quite a bit of items when I find a good sale on vegetables, meats, pizzas, microwave foods, etc. The small basket was great during the summer to store freeze pops for my daughter and her friend.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the interior dimensions of the freezer?\n Answer:","completion":" 25 inches deep (top to bottom), 34 inches wide (side to side), 15 inches (front to back) there is a built in shelf starting 9 inches from the bottom on one side leaving 9 X 15 inches unusable\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: wheels\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, there are two wheels on it making it easy to slightly lift and move\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the energy use?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe that it may be just 150watts...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how much does it weigh\n Answer:","completion":" It's just over 100 pounds. I couldn't lift it by myself into our basement.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why is my Danby 700 making so much noise?\n Answer:","completion":" You should probably call customer service to see where to get it repaired. Because mine runs super quiet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How hot does it get on the outside? I'm keeping it inside the house not in the garage, so it is a concern\n Answer:","completion":" I keep mine in the garage, but I've never noticed it getting warm or hot to the touch on the outside, admittedly. It always feels somewhat cool to the touch, even on hot days (I live south of the OBX, so every day is a hot, humid day).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you plug it into a regular outlet\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. The plug isn't a special kind. Mine is plugged in a regular outlet in my garage.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I live in the northeast and was wondering if anyone has this in their garage or breezeway? Don't know if it can take the temperature swings we have.\n Answer:","completion":" I live in northern Ohio, it goes below freezing regular in the winter. That is supposed to damage the compressor because the oil is cold and stiff and starts hard. I went on ebay and got a Temp controlled outlet for 15 bucks and a little (the smallest they had) stick-on oil pan heater. I sanded the paint off a little spot on the compressor and put it on. It comes on at 35 degrees F and goes off at 45. If you are going to have a freezer out in the cold I think you have to do this to keep from ruining the compressor. So far it's working OK, this freezer goes down to almost 0 F, so it's running at 15 degrees.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with model number: LDE5910ACW Maytag\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure, but the way I did it was to contact my local appliance parts shop and ask them what item I would need to repair my washer and what the price would be.

{"prompt":"Question: My model number is GFE29 HSDASS what is the correct filter?\n Answer:","completion":" Based on the model number you gave me, you have a newer French door standard sized refrigerator which should have a built-in filtering system, meaning you can change the filter from either the front of the unit or somewhere inside the interior. The filter I bought is for an EXTERNAL water line running to the back of my refrigerator. Totally different set up than you have.

It is activated by a protrusion from the lid that fits in this hole when you close the lid to activate it. If you have this style,it is much different than the one you are asking about.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with a Kenmore model# 11068322700 ?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello James, if the dryer is yours you could pretty much operate without an element (it will be cold only), but the question is \"Are you getting a strong air flow?\" I'm not going to tell you what to do before you buy it, but I'm going to tell what I did: I took the element out, I found the broken element, I twisted with a pliers and put it back the the broken element with twisted fix worked again for another another year. Now, elements usually break for the lack of cooling or air flow, so if you put a new element but nobody at home is removing the old lint, the new element is going to burn again. Use your hand and arm and make sure there is no blockage whatsoever inside the duct. Regarding model, before I purchased I went to several sites and found that they are very similar. I thank God, that the guy selling the element in this site, is not running a nuclear power plant, because it would have been smarter to take a picture of the element, than to take a picture of the box, right? At any rate, Amazon is very friendly with returns if it doesn't work you may have 30 days to return. I hope it helped, good luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will these knobs fit whirlpool clean top range,model no. rf376pxyq4\/\n Answer:","completion":" There is really no way to tell because the shape of the fitting that the knob goes on-you have to know what it is-like, my Whirlpool takes D shapes but going in only one direction, and the temp. knob and function have it going another way, and you cannot tell from the back of these knobs because they do not display the shape. I would further research if the parts are still available for your model, if they are discontinued, then Ange Appliance in LA MAY have them, as they rent out period ovens and appliances and stuff for TV shows and movie sets. I had to spend a bit with them to get the exact knobs to replace mine. The knobs aren't all interchangeable!!! You can go to OSH hardware-they sell a brand that comes with adapters. These pictured have no little adapters at all. The OSH ones did not work with our stove, but I was able to return them. Range knob replacement isn't as easy or as cheap as I thought it would be!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What can be done if one of the bakeing elements end break off in the stove\n Answer:","completion":" I do not think that there is anything you can do but replace it; however, our house cleaner pointed out that the element is very close to the surface where it connects and she suggested propping up the element so the distance is greater because anything that connects the element to the inside of the stove will burn off the end of the element.\n"}

My suggestion is to turn off the power and remove the old element and take it to your local appliance store and they should be able to find you a good match.

{"prompt":"Question: what does this part do.my gas oven wont heat up on bake.will this part fix the problem?\n Answer:","completion":" On ovens that use electric ignitors (instead of a pilot light), these ignitor heat up and glow bright yellow and ignite the gas. They are almost so bright you can't look at them. Look for yours underneath the oven where the gas is, turn it on and if yours is orange or dim it needs to be replaced. When the ignitor is on, the gas flows based on the amount of electrical resistance, if yours is failing, the current isn't strong enough so the gas doesn't open fully. This can cause no ignition or extremely slow preheat.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work in a Frigidaire ES340 gas range\n Answer:","completion":" Very likely. Many appliance brands are actually made by a few manufacturers, and they use common components to save cost.....the same gas valves, burners, igniters, etc. Best is to look up the actual part number and check compatibility. Second best is to remove your oven floor pan and visually match it to the product photographs. Be sure to unplug the range first.....120 volts is present at all times in a number of designs. Good luck....\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this work for NXR range?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know--not an appliance expert. Often many different brands use the same parts. If you can get at the ignitor and compare to picture, that should tell you something. Also see if you can find part replacement catalog to get a replacement part number.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this FGF5303935066 fit a Tappen oven w\/part #WCI5303935066\n Answer:","completion":" I put this in my Tappen oven and it worked just fine using the original screws. The old (20+years) igniter had a longer ceramic piece. The new ignitor has a shorter ceramic piece. There was no Molex connector and yu are supposed to use the ceramic wire-nuts. The wire is covered in heat-resistant and seems just fine. I may pack some heat resistant ceramic wool in the ignitor back wall opening where the wires go back in the oven but I have not yet. That probably is an overkill. The only difference is that I did NOT use the ceramic wire nuts provided. I have the tools to disassemble the old Molex connector and install it on the new ignitor with new connector pins.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I've installed this valve but it didn't fix my problem. Included is plastic tubing and fitting, but no instructions on how to install.\n Answer:","completion":" First of all...what is the problem? Are the valves not turning on and off, or is the water just not flowing to the icemaker. My problem was both. Since the water dispenser was working, I 'tested' the old icemaker valve by disconnecting the water dispenser valve's electrical clip and attached it to the icemaker connection. Then pushing the water dispenser lever on the front of the refrigerator I got no water flow and knew the icemaker valve was faulty. Once I replaced the valves and reconnected the water lines, still no water was going to the icemaker. I disconnected the ice water line and tried to blow air through it. Blow hard as there may be water still in the line. I couldn't get air to pass through. Turned out the water line also was frozen on top of the freezer. I unscrewed and removed the icemaker cover to get access to the black water dispensing tube. Usuing a stiff wire and hair drier for about 15 minutes I was finally able to melt the ice in the water supply tube. Problem also could be the electronic control board. If you need to check if that is the problem, set icemaker to ON and pour about a cup of water into the ice cube tray. You should have a set of ice cubes form and ejected within an hour. As for instructions, there are lots of great how-to-videos on YouTube. I think I used this one... https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XAYsVrm2IEg\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: does this wok on the RF217acbp\/xaa model fridge? If it is bad, would that cause the fridge to not start at all and a relay to click?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, I am not a refrigeration technician, but I know a thing or two about this thermister. The answer is \"NO,\" failure of this thermister will not cause the fridge to not start or the relay not to click. All this is is a sensor that tells the contro board when the cooling element is all frosted up and needs to be defrosted so that the control board sends a signal to the switch that turns the defroster element to start the defrost cycle. If your fridge does not start and the relay does not click it would likely be the main control board. It is very common for these boards to go out on these fridges. Hope that was helpful.\n"}

Check that the hanging wire in the ice basket is free & hanging down (sensor that tells it that the ice container is full uses that wire).

For the 885 Wall Cap it cites: \"Do not use for dryer venting\" this has a spring loaded back draft damper and probably concluded that torque would not allow the flap to open all the way for free flow of exhaust\/dryer lint. In short, it's better to be safe from possible Fire Hazard by using a dryer rated exhaust vent. I used this for bath exhaust venting.

{"prompt":"Question: why it does not stay on high continually\n Answer:","completion":" I suspect what you are seeing and asking about is that if you turn the burners on high and just watch them, they glow red quickly but then seem to turn off and on instead of staying bright red and this is different than you are used to on the old-fashioned type of burner. Stoves are automatic systems that turn the electric current on and off as needed to keep the burner at a desired temperature. They don't adjust the amount of electricity applied to the burner...they turn on the power full-blast or completely off. A sensor monitors the temperature and turns the power on if it is too low or turns it off if it is too high. The radiant cook top is a special kind of element that can get VERY hot VERY fast (much faster than the old kind). The temperature sensor is near the element below the glass and the element gets hotter than the hottest setting quickly and turns of the power even though the pot of food above the glass is still not super hot. So you will see the burner get red then go off several times before your food finishes cooking. This is normal. Even though it seems like it would get hot faster if it just stayed on continuously, that would actually be bad because the element would overheat and burn out. Old style burners do the same thing, but you don't notice it as much because they take longer to cool down and stop glowing red so it seems like they are always on when you set them to high (but they aren't). The same thing that makes them stay red longer, also makes them take longer to get hot so if the new element was made to be a lot slower to heat up, it would seem to stay red and it would work like the old kind (but it would take longer to cook your food).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you know if this will work for a GE...looks the same?? I'm not certain of the model #??\n Answer:","completion":" Look carefully at the pin placement- how it plugs in to your stove and the wattage of the unit. Also the size of the opening for the replacement- seems to me the sizing was not correctly listed by the manufacturer.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can all washers use 3\/4\" hoses or do some require 1\/2\"\n Answer:","completion":" As far as I know all North American washing machines use a standard 3\/4\" Garden hose fitting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: When it says \"1\/2 inch i.d.\", is this the inner diameter of the stainless steel hose itself? I want small diameter hose for flexible movement. Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Yes Benda \"i.d.\" refers to inside diameter. The hoses are flexible. Most people use them for connecting the water spigots behind a washer so they won't burst and flood your laundry room. They are quite flexible. I don't think they would fail if flexed a lot every day, but they are metal and would probably eventually have problems. If you're talking about being able to use them with the same flexibility as a rubber washer supply hose they are pretty close.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need this for an extreme flexible hose need (OUTDOORS). Does anyone have a clue if this type of material will hold up well outdoors? Werid I know.\n Answer:","completion":" Given that it's stainless steel it should not rust outdoors. It's made of braided metal material. If this won't hold up I'm not sure what would. It may be remotely possible that if you keep water pressure on and the temperature drops well below freezing you might have a bulge, I just don't know. I can't think it would breach under about any circumstances. I use these for my washer connection because I don't want to have to turn on and turn off my water supply to my washing machine. Hasn't failed me yet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these lead free?\n Answer:","completion":" They say lead free on each hose\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I would like to use these for a backsplash. I need panels that are only about 20\" tall though.

{"prompt":"Question: Can these be mounted separately?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I cut these into a custom shape?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say probably not. It is pretty thick metal. Not sure what tool you would need to cut this. Plus the edges are folded under behind each unit. You would ruin the edging.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does the door open in the front?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Carol, Yes the door opens from the Left side to the Right side in the front. There is no visible handle like on an average refrigerator, it is a hidden handle at the top on the left side. It is indented so you can pull it out. Also, with no handle sticking out...then no one can walk into the handle or get their clothes caught on it. The Danby has a nice top that is strong and can be used as a shelf if needed. It cleans easily too! The Danby DUF408WE is a wonderful freezer and it is Totally Silent when running! When you open the door it has a suction effect and the motor makes a low hum. After you close the door, you can feel and see the door suction inward as it makes it air tight. The Danby is really the best freezer I have ever owned. The Danby is one of the best decisions I ever made! (Hmmm...of course the Best decision I ever made was when I met my wife and we both knew we were Soul Mates for life!) If you choose this model freezer you will not be disappointed. Hope this review helps you? Best regards ~ Marc\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this freezer frost free or must it be defrosted?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a great freezer, we have ours now for nearly 3 years.

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used in a garage. Is it ok in the winter? It would be against the inside wall of the house in the garage?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Mr. Butterfield, My wife and I have our Danby Freezer in a small room in our apartment in NYC. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is constructed so well that there seems to be no reason why it would not do perfectly well in a garage. If I had a garage, I would put the Danby Freezer in it too. Also, the Freezer is Silent when it is on! It makes a very low noise after you open the door and close it, that it sounds like it is making it airtight. The Danby Freezer has heavy duty plastic sliders that move smoothly when pushing the Freezer on a floor, they also adjust in height if a floor is a little off balanced. I feel the sliders on the Danby Freezer would not move easily on a dry cement floor, unless it was painted to a durable and smooth finish. Therefore, I would protect the floor that you put the freezer on from dry cement, corrosion and dampness. I would set the Danby Freezer on top of a 1\/4\" inch thick Plexiglass plastic flooring or something similar. The Danby Freezer is easy to clean and defrosts rather quickly. You can place a small one inch tall long baking pan set on the floor with the door open and any water draining out can be caught in the pan. There are no ice chunks forming inside the Freezer either. It just has a frosty coating or snowy look around the walls and elements inside the Freezer that melt off the interior when it is defrosting. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is the Best Freezer I ever had! You will not be disappointed. Best regards and Happy Holidays for the New Year! ~ Marc\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: My wife wants a front loading freezer like this one, but he's not as flexible as she used to be, can anyone recommend a stand for this?\n Answer:","completion":" You might want to search for an appropriately sized stainless steel food service table to put it on.

{"prompt":"Question: Do they have a adaptor from the old blower 6 in vent to the new 3-12 vent?\n Answer:","completion":" No, I had to purchase an adaptor at HomeDepot, and once fitting it on, it really took up the small vertical space I had to deal with. I gave feedback to GE on this poor design, but received no reply. I actually ended up with an adaptor, then a couple of 6\" duct-elbows and put aluminum flex-hose between the two elbows. Not the best approach to use flex, but I was out of options and space!\n"}

Our house has a duct that goes under the floor and out of the house. If you already have a hood, you don't need a downdraft cook top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Jinn air system with down draft, would this fit without any issue?\n Answer:","completion":" I had a Jenn-air as well, and there were some issues because the old unit was wider by two inches and so the hole in the countertop was too big.

{"prompt":"Question: can 2 or more of these hoses be connect together? and can this be hooked up to the LG 14,000 btu Port AC\n Answer:","completion":" It IS physically possible to couple any number of these flexible hoses together; I have done so. For each coupling, you will need a round collar, about four inches outside diameter, and two hose clamps to hold each hose to the collar. I've found these items at Home Depot; probably any store that carries irrigation\/sprinkler parts would have them. For the collar, I used a THREE inch coupler, designed to couple two pieces of three inch (interior diameter) sprinkler line together, fitting over the outside of the two pieces of sprinkler line. However, you should seriously consider whether how long a hose line will work in your application. Best wishes!\n"}

In other words, can the downdraft be made to work with the downdraft already in our floor for the Jenn-Aire, does it work the same way or is it entirely a...\n Answer:","completion":" You should be able to connect up to an existing duct which undoubtedly will pass thorough the base of your cabinet. If its 6 in diameter vent pipe (most likely) you will need a transition from the rectangular blower on this cooktop to the round duct and perhaps and adjustable angle. Just make sure you have about 15\" to 20\" of clearance to allow for the transition to the round duct. Its a relatively simple connection, but may require a few pipe parts to make the turn and reconnect to your existing pipe (depending upon where it is in the cabinet. Hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be trimmed to size? I have an area that is 30\" X 21 1\/2\" behind my range.\n Answer:","completion":" Here is my best guess. I would imagine that it can be trimmed but I would take it to a sheet metal shop where they would have the proper tools to trim it to size without putting any bends or creases in it. This piece comes with finished edges and you would have to keep in mind that if you trim it in any way, that you are cutting off one or more of the finished edges. Personally; I don't think I would try to trim it myself for fear of damaging or destroying the piece. I hope this is of some help to you. A sheet metal shop wouldn't charge you much, if anything, to trim it for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I feel stupid tonight. Is that one inch or 1\/10 of an inch thick?I want to lay it on a counter. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I believe it is 1\/10th. It is pretty thin.

{"prompt":"Question: My appliances are brushed stainless steel. Is the back splash shinny or brushed?\n Answer:","completion":" It is brushed. I suppose the reason they do this is so that any little defects that would show up in a shiny piece won't be as noticeable with brushed. Hope this helps. P.S. It's still pretty shiny.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are all edges the same..could I mount it \"long side going up and Down\" and it will look the same..\n Answer:","completion":" All edges are factory quality.

{"prompt":"Question: Is it magnetic\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is. Just checked it with my cooking timer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be installed over ceramic tile?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it could be installed over tile by using plenty of thin double sided tape or by caulking (or putting adhesive on the back). The sheet is reasonably thin, so as long as you don't try to secure it at only the 4 corners it should look ok.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what type of stainless steel is this???\n Answer:","completion":" I think it's a stainless steel. It's been great for me. It's thin and could be cut easily if needed. It looks great as the back splash behind my stove.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the difference between WSW-1 vs WSW-2?\n Answer:","completion":" They are exactly the same water filter.

{"prompt":"Question: will this filter work in a kenmore side by side model #58787892.\n Answer:","completion":" I cannot verify it will work with your Kenmore fridge, but I would suggest removing your old filter and measuring the dimensions of it and comparing to the product detail dimensions of this filter.

{"prompt":"Question: Will these fit a Tappan electric stove? Older model, no model number, 20 yrs +\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know, because my stove is a mix of different brand parts, but they fit a variety of sizes & shapes. Does yours have little posts when you pull the knob off? These have a variety of inserts - with different sizes & shapes of hole and only one will fit your stove's knob. You push that insert into the knob to adapt the knob. I think the only caution is to look at the photo of the knobs to be sure the numbers go in the right direction - the same as your stove - so low & high will be in the right place and not the reverse. The numbers on my old ones were worn off, so I had to figure it out by moving them.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: commercial gas range\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know, I bought them for my (30) year old residential range & they didn't work at all, because the plastic valve connection adapters below the dials are too short to reach the actual valve stem.

{"prompt":"Question: commercial gas range\n Answer:","completion":" They are very cheaply made.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these fit a thermador gas stove top?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not familiar with the Thermador. Whether or not these \"universal\" knobs will work depends upon the length of your current phenolic (plastic) knob shaft below the indicator dial face. Pull the whole dial knob off & measure the length of the dial shaft (below the dial face) that connects to the mating portion of the valve operating stem below your cook-top. If that (plastic) shaft is longer than about 3\/4\", it probably won't work. I have a Chambers cook top with phenolic dial shafts that are 1-1\/4\" long. This didn't work for me, everything was too short. This is frustrating, I could sketch up a view of what I'm trying to explain in (30) seconds, but that's not possible in this format. Hope this helps, good luck. Mike\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this replace a 700854-4 jenn.air knob?\n Answer:","completion":" Honestly, I'm not sure. My package came with adapters that varied. Look closely at your posts that hold the knows and the should work if the pattern matches.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this a direct replacement for a Littelfuse 125V 2.5A 250VAC refidgerator door light switch?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, fits the older model Subzero\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this work in a sub zero 550, mine is from about 1994, the switch says littelfuse on it\n Answer:","completion":" It worked in my 1993 model 590. If your switch looks the same as the one in the photo, then I'd say give it a try. It's less than five bucks with free shipping so it's a pretty low-risk purchase, especially compared to the price of a service call (in my experience).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this switch work in a 590 Sub Zero refrigerator\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: hi--the last switch did the trick for light in fre subzero 511--will the same switch work for the fan switch?? looks to be same switch thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Looking at a similar question on this item (http:\/\/amzn.to\/1IdMKuT) it appears that the fan switch is NOT the same as the light switch. The light turns on when the door is open but the fan turns off when the door is open.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it fit a sub zero 611?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Works great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be open and repaired or must it be replaced? I was able to open the connector side, clean &amp; it works fine. Not sure if this is a good idea.\n Answer:","completion":" In my view, replacement is your best bet. the cost of the light switch is low, replacement is easy. Unless your fridge is not old, I would just replace the switch if you start tinkering with it.

If you consider \"long term use\" as somewhat longer than 90 days, I have a pair that burst after two years. A \"Warranty\" isn't of any value and strictly limited to the replacement of the failed hoses within 90 days, not the thousands of dollars in damage their burst hose can cause.

{"prompt":"Question: Is this compatible with GE Oven JK955SOF3SS?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not familiar with that oven, so I have no idea. However, it would probably work with any oven with a temp probe socket. I use mine in an Astivita brand oven, and it works perfectly.

{"prompt":"Question: What triggers the \"Replace Filter\" indicator light, a meter or a timer? If it's a timer, isn't it likely that filters are often changed prematurely?\n Answer:","completion":" On our Maytag, there is a \"Replace Filter\" light that changes from Green to red. The packaging says says change every 6 months, but ours usually lasts a year on average before it turns red. I believe it is calculated on the number of gallons that passes through the filter. We are a house hold of 2 people and 2 dogs. It has average a year of usage consistently for 7 years. Now if you had a house hold of 4-5 people, it may last a shorter period. But I do believe it is based on the number of gallons that passes through the filter that triggers the change filter indicator.\n"}

Your only way to know for sure is to find out exactly from Braun or do the five or six measurements it takes to research it which I did using hdsupplysolutions.com's manual. Clicking noise to me sounds like the blade is hitting something and might just need adjusted.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit a NuTone 663L\/669L\/\"A\" Unit circa 1995? I can't tell from the Broan parts guide either. Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" If you have 663L, with a paddle wheel fan, per what is shown in this listing, the 97012038 is the correct replacement part. If you have the 669L with a squirrel cage blower this is not the correct part and NuTone makes no reference to what is. You may just want to purchase the Broan-NuTone 690NT upgrade kit.

Seems the most important issue for me was the fan blade diameter, was it going to fit the opening in the hood, it was fine.\n"}

It was a disappointment (should have followed up on an Amazon review). Suggestion: I replaced with an Ambient Weather Station WS-1171 which provides the following: indoor\/outdoor temperatures & humidity levels, plus dewpoints, barometric pressure & history, time, day, date, and it has an active indicator which (in conjunction with barometer) shows changes in the weather ie. cloudy to sunshine, rain to sun, etc. One small sensor unit sits outside & the display unit sits inside your home in a convenient location.

This is situated outside the house or apartment. The increase of water pressure will blow-out any air in the system. If other utilities are up to pressure, dishwasher shower etc., the problem will be with the machine or your supply pipe which should be 3\/4 diameter not 1\/2 diameter (copper pipe). Good luck.

I've done it and it is now partially stuck to my stove. Not sure why it isn't designed to withstand what could be considered an average oven temperature. Plastic will only withstand so much heat so it may be wise to see if there are non plastic ones availabie. So, yes, it will melt.\n"}

It has a magnetic strip on the inside that is glued on so you would have to cut through that. The other material is a very hard plastic that might splinter\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is better on a oven glass top or burners\n Answer:","completion":" Since it fits between the stove and counter top it shouldn't make any difference. It's just wide enough to fill in the crack between the two. Hope that helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do you install the Whirlpool Dishwasher fill value W10158389?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure what exactly you need to know, but I presume you understand that you need to turn the dishwasher off from electric panel, then shut the water coming to the it off as well. I also presume you know how to get to the part by removing the access panel and some insulation. The part should be on the left side. When you remove the old valve out you need to understand that taking the screws out is not enough to remove it. You need to \"unhook\" (if I can say it) from the frame it is mounted on. Try t wiggle it up and down gently and to the sides and you will be able to detach it from the frame. This way you will be able to bring the valve closer to yourself and you will be able to see and access the electric plug and incoming water hose and out coming water hose. So, unplug the plug that supplies the voltage to the old valve by squeezing the \"locks\" on the plug. The plug unplugs similarly to the telephone line from the phone outlet or network cable. Keep in mind that the plug might be stuck. So, you may want to move it to the sides gently. If it does not come out it may mean that you are not squeezing it right (find that release latch). Then you need to take off the incoming water supply hose and outcoming water hose. One of them can be twisted off using adjustable wrench while the other (thinner one) has a wire based spindle (I hope I call it right), which secures the hose on the valve. Some remaining water will come out. So, it is a good idea to have a towel in that area to capture that water before disconnecting the hoses. Then you do everything in reverse using the new valve. Make sure that the thin hose fits all the way on the new valve and is secured with the wire spindle again. This may require some effort to do it. Also when you put the thick hose back be gentle and do not over tighten the nut of the hose.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the contact between two flanges? Or just two simple piece plastics?\n Answer:","completion":" It is all plastic.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should the two pieces in which one is male and one is female to have nice fit?\n Answer:","completion":" I've installed two of these and they work great. It is not really a \"male-female\" structure, rather there are inter-locking tabs or hooks on the two flanges. It makes for a nice attachment that locks in to place solidly yet unhooks and comes apart easily as well.\n"}

My dryer dock is secured tight to my wall with screws and the quick connect part twists in to the screwed in side to make a snug connection. Maybe one of your tabs has broken off the screwed in side making for a loose connection?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If the rack is facing the sink it drains into the sink, how\/where does the extra slide out tray drain?\n Answer:","completion":" it doesn't. The water sits there and you get your arms and chest wet everytime.

{"prompt":"Question: My stove is about 1\" lower than the counter top with about 1\/2\" gap between the two. Will this work? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think the would look good. You probably should use a shim of 1\" under these and they would look ok.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone had trouble with the Frigidaire Gallery smooth top slide in range. When I turn on the oven the broiler lights and causes a fire in the ove\n Answer:","completion":" I have the freestanding range. Your broiler element may be going out and need to be replaced.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does the dryer vent hose exit the rear of the dryer or out the top of the dryer??\n Answer:","completion":" Rear\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how deep is this and what r other measurements\n Answer:","completion":" It's 26 7\/8\" wide, 75 1\/4\" tall and 28\" deep. We were not able to put the folding door back as it's deeper than the Whirlpool we had but it's a full size washer and dryer. I've cut my washing down to less than half since I can wash all my whites in one load. Before I had to wash the queen sheets and 2 loads, now there's room for the set and everything else.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you guys generally leave the door open between loads? Is the seal easy to wipe out? I wash everything in cold so wonder if I'll get mold?\n Answer:","completion":" We wash with cold only too, and leave the door open a little. The seal is easy to wipe out. I haven't given it the test, of closing the door, as I don't want that moldy smell. We had a different brand before this one, and it got smelly if you closed the door for very long - and we only used cold water there too. We've had this unit in about 9 or 10 months now, and it is the best unit we've ever owned. We have a very limited water well, and the 13.8 gallons per load is wonderful - and they are BIG loads too. It is located in an area where everything can be heard, yet it is very quiet. We love it so far!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone have this installed on a wood floor? Any vibration or \"walking\" issues? If so, how did you fix them?\n Answer:","completion":" I have these units installed on terrazzo decking on a Navy barge. I restrain the \"pair\" by strapping them to the wall.

{"prompt":"Question: 2 questions: Is this part that you are selling made by Whirlpool? And, what is the warranty on this item? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" It is not an OEM part. I don't remember there being a warranty, and installing it might void your washer warranty if it is still in effect.

{"prompt":"Question: Does it get all of the detergent and softner out when rinsing the clothes?\n Answer:","completion":" I think of my Wonderwash as a hand crank front loader. The key to the Wonderwash is to not over load it. You need head space so that the cloths can tumble while washing and rinsing. I use liquid detergent and softener together while washing, which consists of 200 rotations forward and back. I then let the cloths drain and I refill the tub for a rinse cycle. After another 200 rotations, I drain the water and put the cloths in my spin dryer, which will remove the soap, softener and dyes. I return the clothing to the Wonderwash for the final rinse of 200 rotations and then back to the spin dryer where the water comes out pretty clear and if it doesn't, then i go for another rinse. Keep in mind you can not do your laundry in bulk and for this reason, I believe, that my cloths come out cleaner, which you will notice with your colored cloths by how much dye will be removed when using the Wonderwash and a spin dryer combination for the first time. Cloths that I've had for years, when washed in my Wonderwash for the first time, released a lot of dye, which totally shocked me and made me realize that my cloths weren't really clean at all. For me, obtaining a spin dryer was the key to the whole process. You need to see the water being released from the cloths to decide if they need rinsed another time! Hope this helps. :-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How dry are the clothes after washing? One of the challenges I have with sink washing is it takes forever to air dry.\n Answer:","completion":" Very wet and it is amazing how long it takes clothes to dry that way. That is why I bought a mini-dryer as well so for about $100 total for the washer and dryer, our family cleans delicates and daily wash when we don't have a full load in these units. The kids actually have fun doing the laundry and we leave the majority of clothes for our front-loaders. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002HT0958\/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many items fit in this product?\n Answer:","completion":" We usually don't pack more than 6 large mens t-shirts. The clothes need space to move around in order to get clean. Usually one pair of jeans will fit. Sometimes you can put two pairs of women's jeans if they are a thinner material. I've done some larger loads of light clothes like underwear, undershirts, and tanks. I wash many pairs of socks by themselves (up to 15 pairs at a time).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be able to wash a pair of large men's jeans? I'm thinking of getting one of these for \"in-between\" washing.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Comparing this to the Laundry POD, this seems to not dry clothes as well? Can you not spin dry the clothes after a rinse?\n Answer:","completion":" No. I just let it drain until it stops dripping. Last rinse I usually let it drain for 10-15 min. You still have to wring out clothes. Different clothes, of course, hold more or less water....but the ones on the bottom definitely have more water in them!\n"}

It has an amazing capacity much larger than it looks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you wash towels in it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you technically can but I don't know that you would want to. While the Wonderwash is great for lighter clothes but for heavy towels, it's a pain to dry. Not so much difficulty with the washing but the drying part is a little bit of a pain. Having said that, even though I used the Wonderwash for lighter clothes only, I still managed to reduce my electric bill by $50 a month so it's really worth it, if you have the time.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How I supposed to make it work ?My house works 110 V.\n Answer:","completion":" You will need to have a 220v outlet wired from your breaker box.

{"prompt":"Question: will the extender work if my stove top is slightly higher then counter top?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes that's how my stove is too. The extender will just sit a little lower than the the sides of your stove.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are they made out of?\n Answer:","completion":" The extenders are a plastic material.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a ceramic top free standing range and need some thing to fill the gap between the range and counter top. Are these heat resistent?\n Answer:","completion":" Heat resistent, YES. However will warp and burn if directly on\/nect to a burner. Be careful if you have to trim them in any way. Use an extremely sharp blade and do not bend them, otherwise they will not straighten out very well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the extenders heat resistend? I have a Gas stove will it work?\n Answer:","completion":" They're extremely hard plastic. The stove top and oven can get pretty hot and they still look new. So, I'd probably say yes as long as you are not placing it directly near or on the burner or on the oven door.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these work if my stove is slightly lower than my countertop?\n Answer:","completion":" It would depend how much lower. They slide between the stove and the counter top so they would probably work just one end of the slider would be lower than the other side. The bottom of the extender is about 1 inch maybe slightly more from what I can remember, so I don't see why it would not work. You'd have to purchase the item and if it didn't fit to your liking, you can always return it. Is there anyway that you can possibly increase the height of your stove by placing some type of solid foundation underneath the legs of the stove to bring it up to meet your countertop?\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is minimum width that this unit will fit. I want to make sure it will not be too tight to fit\n Answer:","completion":" EACH extender is 3\/16 of an inch wide. Be sure to add this to the width of your stove to determine if you have clearance between the counter tops.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this just one or a pair of these extenders?\n Answer:","completion":" it's been awhile since i bought these, but I believe it came with two.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this truly 5\/8 inch? Or is it 1\/2 inch?\n Answer:","completion":" The rubber magnet which runs along the edge of the extender is 1\/2 \" wide (stove side). This forms a tight seal which keeps out crumbs and spills. The top of the extender is 3\/4 \" wide. Which is more than plenty to form a sweeping transition from stove to counter. Very easy to remove and clean with soap and water. Never had a problem pulling them off. Never have bent the extenders while removing. Super design and quality for sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a filter to keep clean or any other maintaince called for? (I bought a used one w\/o user manual)\n Answer:","completion":" No. There are no filters or any other maintenance items to keep track of. it is very easy to keep clean. It does not even seem to accumulate lint. The clothes are only there for two or three minutes; that may be the reason why. Note; if you accidentally forget about it and let it spin for a long time, it will shut itself off as it is thermally protected. I did this once. It shut off after about 15 minutes and would not re-start for another 15 or 20 but then it was fine.\n"}

If it's not available on Amazon, try going directly to The Laundry Alternative's website, their prices are lower.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long will it last? I am concerned it will break after 6 months.\n Answer:","completion":" My suspicion is that the reason people have it break so quickly is because they run it with the load unbalanced. It is INCREDIBLY difficult to get the load properly balanced, and if you allow it to run unbalanced it destroys the motor. I've had mine for four months, and it hasn't broken yet, but we shall see. Personally, I wouldn't buy it again because of the load balancing issue, even if it doesn't break. When this one bites the dust, I'm going to look for one that is shorter and fatter (since I think the shape of it is a factor in why it's hard to balance the load), and if I can't find one, I'm just going to let my clothes line dry.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone have any GOOD things to say? I just bought this but it won't be delivered for 15 biz days so I have time to cancel if necessary. I thought Maytag was a good brand until I saw all this about the control panel. Now I'm considering canceling...\n Answer:","completion":" We have had ours for over a year and have really enjoyed it. We particularly like the interior, and the automatic cleaning cycle. We had no problems with the panel when I first installed it. We still don't have problems, but we just had granite countertops installed and it is a rough cut edge and it extends out further than our prior top. We have to bend over a bit more to better see the panel, but it is no real issue. I also like that the panel is now better protected from anything dripping on it. Also will note that it is extremely quiet. I would buy another one. We have had Kenmore and Kitchen Aid before. I will never go back to a kitchen aid. Too many issues and repair calls on that one.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: why is there condensation moisutre after my cycle is done in my stainless steel inside dishwasher\n Answer:","completion":" I have the same dishwasher, and everything in my washer is covered in condensation when they heat cycle is finished, even when using the Extra Dry feature. We called Maytag, and they sent out the most rude condescending repairman I have ever encountered in my life. He explained that when the dry cycle is finished within 30 minutes you must open the door and allow the dishes to dry, and had I read my instruction manual I would know this. Then he continued to rant that he could not believe that Maytag had sent him on another one of these calls instead of just explaining that over the phone. I am returning mine today. Had I wanted to air dry my dishes I would not of spent $800.00 on a new dishwasher, and my next one will not be a Maytag. I have also read my instruction manual, and no where does it mention this.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: to shut off ONE burner is there an on-off button. do you have to press and hold it down as it drops from whatever setting you were cooking at until 0?\n Answer:","completion":" Dear John, This model has a numerical setup within the control panel. To select the heat level, you select the corresponding element and then the number for the heat level. For Example, you select the image of the front left element on the panel, then the number 5 for medium heat. To manually turn off the burner, you would select the element and then 0 for the heat level.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the unit shut off just by moisture or wiping the glass at the controls?\n Answer:","completion":" Dear John, This model does have several safety features that will automatically shut off the heating elements. For example, it will shut of the heating element when a spillover is detected. If you are trying to wipe up spills near the controls, we recommend you use the clean lock\/child lock function which will avoid any changes to the controls while wiping that area. My favorite shutoff feature is the timer which lets you decide exactly how long the heating element should be on and will shut it off when the time expires. This model will also shut off the element with a warning indicator if an improper material is placed on an element, or if a proper pan is not placed within 90 seconds of the element being turned on.\n"}

I just put one in, after using the Drop for a few days, and the output seems to be significantly diminished.\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know - have not used this humidifier without filter.

Check under your sink to see if you have an outlet, and an on\/off switch near the sink. I hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the Evolution Essential model interchangeable with the Contractor 333 model\n Answer:","completion":" It's been a while since I installed this, and we've since moved. I do believe that the broken one I replaced was the contractor model. I used the old drain, which worked fine. I believe there was something funky about the wiring, but it couldn't have been too bad, as I am not a mechanic...(See the idea about using a auto jack to hold the disposal in place while working with it.)

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work for a duet WASHER?? I can't seem to find and reversal kit for my WASHER!!! Model #WFW9150WW01\n Answer:","completion":" I cant't answer specifically to this model, but I have learned while searching for reversal kit for my washer that \"DUET\" includes MANY DIFFERENT MODEL#s and the so called \"universal\" kits are not one size fits all! Call Whirlpool and confirm the exact part number for the reversal kit that fits your washer, then start searching for that specific part #.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this wringer work best attached to a steel tub? Would 20 \/12, 22, or 24 inch width tub be the best size?\n Answer:","completion":" The wringer is very heavy and it does need to be attached to a tub. I use a metal tub. It would have to be a very heavy duty plastic to be able to support the wringer. I do suggest using a metal tub.. The tub needs about 20 inches of straight side to secure it. I use a large oval tub. a round tub would not work, as it would not have the straight side to secure the wringer to. I put the wet clothes into the tub and wring them, putting them into another basket. The wet clothes gives the weight to secure the tub and as I wring them then the water that is squeezed out and falls back into the tub gives me the weight I need to balance out the weight of the wringer on the tub. Securing it to an empty tub will cause the whole thing will tip over.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This seems like a lot of money for a simple mechanical product. Does the manufacture provide replacement parts, particularly the rollers?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sorry I don't know if you can get replacement parts but the unit is built so well and I've used it a lot since I've owned it and has performed beautifully. I have taken mine apart just to lubricate the rolling points I put silicone paste on the moving parts in glides a lot easier, hope you find this helpful\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be attached to a table to use as a fondant roller\n Answer:","completion":" It can be attached to a table. The wringers are adjustable to accommodate different items; being unfamiliar with working with fondant, I'm not sure about that use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone let me know the tub you use that attaches to this product successfully?\n Answer:","completion":" My husband put in two utility sinks. We put the wringer in the middle of them. Clamping them together. But it would slip a lot so my husband put two bolts through the sinks and wringer and it works perfectly. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do the rollers actualy touch each other? I want to uses something like this to roll thin film from a larger roll and the rollers would have to touch.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they touch. You can adjust the tension between them as well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many inches wide can the clamps be expanded? In other words, how wide a stand can they attach to?\n Answer:","completion":" As you face the wringer the wide way, the two clamps are right at 14\" apart and are NOT adjustable. I have the wringer fastened to an old outdoor end table, mounted onto a 2 x 4 on its edge. but the clamps could probably clasp over something as thick as 2 1\/4 to 2 1\/2\" perhaps. This is the second one of these I've owned and sure beats wringing by hand which is hard on your wrists as you age (I'm 65). I do recommend that once you're done using it, to release the pressure from the rollers.......will keep them from \"flat spotting.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I would like to attach this to the side of my tub in the bathroom. The tub side width is 4 inches....how could I attach this?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, I use this to wring out towels for drying my car. I attached to a 1X4. I do not think it would work on a tub.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are both rollers driven by the crank?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes and it's work good also\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the crank really loud or noisy? Another person stated in their review \"Plus cranking the handle is noisy\".\n Answer:","completion":" Sometimes. We would occasionally grease ours - it helped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am looking to use a ring to get meat out of crab legs. Anyone try it with this product&gt;\n Answer:","completion":" not with this product but a rolling pin on a table works well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much laundry detergent do you use?\n Answer:","completion":" For 2-3 gallons, maybe 1 tablespoon and 1 tablespoon white vinegar to break up the smell in my clothes because I sweat so bad.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need to pull the plunger out of the water to fill with air, or do you keep it submerged?\n Answer:","completion":" You don't pull the plunger all the way out. You fill the bucket so that it just covers the lower part of the plunger and a portion of the top part. When you raise the plunger a few inches, the air goes in through the top portion called \"the breather.\" I find this product very effective and easy to use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you do if it falls apart? Mine did\n Answer:","completion":" Screw it back in, the whole thing screws together, if it falls apart it has gotten loose so just screw it back together like you did when you first assembled it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm assuming you use it with a bucket, how big?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased two 5 gallon buckets from Home Depot.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm assuming you use it with a bucket, how big?\n Answer:","completion":" Your bucket & how to use it: I use a 5 gallon bucket (you know, the kind sold at home improvement stores with the company's name & logo on them). Given the diameter of the washer, anything smaller shall probably be too narrow. However, if you can handle to weight of the water, you could use a larger vessel. For most batches of laundry, I fill the bucket half way (2 1\/2 gallons) along with my detergent, agitate a few times to develop some suds, and then add the dirty laundry. Agitate like mad for as little as 30 seconds (for lightly soiled & delicate items) to 90 seconds (heavy things like jeans). If the item(s) being cleaned are very soiled (ground in gardening dirt on the knees), I find a good minute agitate followed by a soak for a couple hours and finished with another minute agitate will lift the ground in mud.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be effective for a pair of jeans? Doing a dozen of: socks, underwear, shirts. Loads to small to take to the laundrymat\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is the handle\n Answer:","completion":" I think they forgot to give me the handle because I didn't get one. I read somewhere that the handle was small. I bought a mop and unscrewed the handle, then just used that. It worked out fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many clothes (say t-shirts) can you comfortably fit into it without stuffing them in? On average how much can you wash at one time?\n Answer:","completion":" I used a 6 gallon round plastic bucket, and I put in 3 pairs of levis. It seemed just about right. Get a wringer or else your stuff will take forever to dry on a line.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long do you do this on a load of laundry ?\n Answer:","completion":" Personally I shoot for about 6 minutes -but- I break it up- I go about 2 min at a time and let it soak several minutes in between. I feel this really is effective. I usually give it 2 rinses- but agitate it for maybe 1 min each time. This really is a great little gadget.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this device good for getting out tough stains? Is this better than using my hands?\n Answer:","completion":" Oh my gosh, YES! You should try to pretreat the tough stain with a bar of laundry soap like Fels Naptha or Zote. Use the washer on the clothing and then let it soak for really bad stains. Then go back to washing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you take it apart and put it back together with both Inlet and Outlet facing the same direction.I'm up against a concrete top and bottom.\n Answer:","completion":" Also, these situations require a lot of ingenuity and customizing. DO NOT USE DUCT TAPE. Buy the special aluminum tape. I was told by two other people that duct tape would fall off due to the heat. I bought the special tape mentioned in one of the reviews. By the time you have crafted a custom vent and installed it in a very tight space (with lots of trial and error, especially getting the vent taped to the outlet and inlet) you will have so much time invested that it is not worth the risk of using duct tape and finding out that everyone else was right!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What gauge metal is it made of?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure. Its really thin though. I was capable of bending by hand and cutting with tin snips easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my wall opening is a bit higher then the dryeroutlet, as well as about 4'' to the side.. i can't move the dryer to line up the wall opening\/dryer .\n Answer:","completion":" This thing should work. It is not a plug-n-play solution, however. You will need foil tape, and tin snips to adjust the thing to the right size. Also, you will need to somehow get behind there to put the large hose-clamps in place and tighten them. It took me about 45min to get it set up, but since then it has been great. There is less resistance that my old flexible hose so the clothes dry much faster. I'd make sure that the periscope has the right opening dimensions so that it will match with your wall vent and the port on the back of the dryer. The 4\" and a bit to the side should not be an issue. Good luck! BTW, you many want to wear some type of gloves so you don't cut yourself on the metal when you install it. ;)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My offset (mid dryer pipe to wall exit pipe) is nine inches. Will this unit work?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the 0-5\" refers to the center to center. You need longer 0-18\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Earlier I asked whether this was standard size (for washer). Duh. What I meant was standard dryers. Is hole standard diameter?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: When fully extended, are there 5 inches between the inlet and outlet edges or centers?\n Answer:","completion":" As I recall more like 4 inches. Very difficult to get an accurate measurement. However there is a big improvement in the drying time since installing this product\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the crimped end fit inside the 4\" pipe that vents to the outside? If so, how do I secure this connection?\n Answer:","completion":" yes it fits inside. It just seemed to be snug enough not to pop out. It has been ok for over a year.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: All the image shows is the tubing. Does this come with the entire \"KIT\"? Does it have the connections to add to PEX Tubing supply line under sink?\n Answer:","completion":" No, what you see is what you get. It's the PEX tubing with the attached fittings as shown.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this with a newer GE side by side fridge?\n Answer:","completion":" I have used it w a Kenmore Elite side by side. It is very likely going to work, new fridge icemaker connections tend to be stadardized. The user's manual may have a section on the ice maker hookup and tell you what type of connection your fridge has.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: One of the questions' answers indicated this is NOT the kit and does NOT include the fittings for a new fridge. Which fittings do I need to purchase?\n Answer:","completion":" It works exactly as a copper line. It's like the lead pipe but in PVC which is way more convenient.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this attach to a standard 1\/4 compression fitting or if the nut on one end is cut off will the tubing attach to a 1\/4 shark-bite fitting.\n Answer:","completion":" Both ends have a 1\/4 inch compression nut. The receiving fitting must have a wide enough opening to receive the end of the pex tube (look at the blown-up picture). This should fit just fint on the inlet on the fridge. On the other end, depends what you have installed. There are at least 2 types of copper shut off valves, one of these (a fitting for a flanged copper line I believe) will not work. Yes, if you cut off one end, it should fit the shark-bite. Btw _H_D_ also carries this exact line (except GE branded)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this product suitable for attaching to fridge and tiny cold water tap on wall behind fridge? Apt. plumbed with tiny tap.\n Answer:","completion":" This attaches using a pressure fitting at each end, not appropriate for a cold water tap. If you get a saddle valve to tap the copper line to the cold water, then you could hook this from the saddle valve to the fridge, or you could look for a diverter valve adapter to attach to the faucet ,and then this to the compression fitting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have 3\/8\" PEX plumbing in my house. Can I attach this 5' tube to 3\/8\" PEX. Is there an adapter\/ coupler\n Answer:","completion":" When I attached the ice maker and dish washer I used shut off valves. A kit (in the wall) for the ice maker and just an inline valve for the dish washer. There are valves made to push directly onto the PEX and have the compression fitting for the ice maker line. If you use a kit then use one of the PEX to FPT connectors. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the packaging that comes with this supply hose state that it is lead free? Does it meet CA Prop 65 requirements for lead free?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure what the packaging says, but the hose is plastic, so I would assume that it is lead free based on that. Don't have anything concrete to though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the tubing 1\/4\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it's 1\/4\" internal diameter tubing -- standard for most refrigerator water\/ice maker lines.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: After installing new filters, do they need to have water run through them before they are used for drinking?\n Answer:","completion":" We don't, and unlike other water filters the water doesn't come out a slightly grey color. If you do notice that discolor just dump out the water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you tell me how many filters are in this pack?\n Answer:","completion":" Just one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just installed one of these filters, water didn't come through when I turned faucet on, tried to remove filter and reinstall and it exploded??\n Answer:","completion":" I ran into the same problem when i bought replacement filters (in the past) from somebody besides clear2o. You can really hurt your hand if you build up enough pressure before trying to remove. The supplier did make good on a replacement since i wasn't the first one that this has happened to. I have since paid a little extra to buy from CLEAR, and have not received a faulty one yet. I hope that this helps. Thanks\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter have a micron rating?\n Answer:","completion":" I checked the box and instruction sheet, doesn't seem to be a rating... 1-800-231-9786 USA\/Canada\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these filters remove fluoride? If not, are there any filters available for the Pitcher that are capable of doing so?\n Answer:","completion":" The description on the page says: \"This CLEAR2O pitcher filter features block carbon media and is NSF certified to reduce 53 contaminants, including cysts, asbestos, mercury and lead.\" I think you'd have to go to their webpage and perhaps ask the question of their staff.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a CWS100AW. How do i know when I'm suppoed to change the filter for my pitcher?\n Answer:","completion":" The little window to the left of the handle turns from green to yellow to red. When it's all the way red, change the filter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The expiration date for these filters is a \"date code,\" not a Julian calendar date. My next filter is code \"8142\". How do I decipher this code?\n Answer:","completion":" my filter is color coded....turns red from white as it gets older....then turns black when it is fully black it is time to replace....i don't have a date code? not much help to you i guess.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why is the three pack of replacement filters more expensive (44.9) than the single at 9.99 Is there a cartridge that fits inside the filter?\n Answer:","completion":" The 3-pack of filters is from a different seller. It's not uncommon for some sellers to have prices that are higher even if they'd selling a multi-pack. Always check prices carefully. I have been buying single filters. They last a LONG time for me though I am the only person using the pitcher. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference in the CWF 1012 filter and the CWF 1016 filter for the Clear 2 O pitcher\n Answer:","completion":" There are a variety of numbers that seem to fit the same pitcher. Call the manufacturer and they will tell you if these two are the same.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the power cable\/plug included ?\n Answer:","completion":" Due to the varied outlets from home to home, the power cord, or pigtail, is not included with any new range.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: has anyone had issues with the warming burner not shutting off?\n Answer:","completion":" Not as of yet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the smooth cooktop suitable for cast iron or heavy pressure canners?\n Answer:","completion":" The Cooktop is glass therefore scratchable, chipable, and breakable. So can you use cast iron? yes, but it is not recommended and the weight and ruggedness of the cast will easily scratch and chip the top. So you have to be careful. The weight of the pots just make it easier to bang the pot on it. I would not use the cast, but it can be done. I have used an allumnium pressure pot seems to work ok. I would say no to cast iron save those for your gas camp stove.. Also it does take longer to heat for example to boil water than the traditional electric.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many burners?? I am looking for a commercial type range for my church. Is this in that leage?\n Answer:","completion":" I sincerely doubt it. This has four conventional burners, one of which has two size options. There Is a warming burner suitable for melting butter. This is a great stove but hardly a commercial range.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the left oven door open down or sideways?\n Answer:","completion":" The door swings open sideways to the left, is a pretty small oven, for bread or oblong dish, as it is only 9.5\" wide\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If installation is purchased, is the power cable included as part of the installation fee?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think it did\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come in white?\n Answer:","completion":" Mary Jo, Unfortunately, it does not. All Frigidaire professional ranges are Stainless Steel. However, Frigidaire does have two 40\" electric models in White. They are the FFEF4015LW & FFEF4005LW if you want to take a look at them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the edges need rubber feet to ward against countertop scratches? What material is the cover made of...20 gauge steel?\n Answer:","completion":" I put a strip of door-edge protector on the front lip to do just that. Material is a combination of cast and heavy sheet steel. Quality is actually pretty decent. Two small hinges mount with a couple of sheet metal screws into the counter right behind the burners.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the cover open 180 degrees?\n Answer:","completion":" We have two burner cover and it stands straight up when open. I have complete access to total burner top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this unit have the folding side extensions?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think it does. I ended up returning mine because it required me to drill holes in my countertop for proper installation. However, after my last few camping trips I'm considering repurchasing it. :) As I recall, it was hinged along the back and you raised it up in the front for use. The top and sides were one solid piece.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the description says black, but the picture is white. what color is the unit? thx.\n Answer:","completion":" Mine came with a black handle area and the rest was stainless steel.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this washer come with hose that connect to the sink and tap? If I need to get it where do I get it???\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: May I ask how long the inlet hose and the drain hose are? I want to make sure they are long enough for reach my washer connection.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't have my machine any more but I did love it. I connected the hoses to the kitchen faucet when I used the machine so they must have been around three feet in order to reach there, but I can't say with accuracy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have an oval shaped faucet. Will the adaptor work with that?\n Answer:","completion":" I have never seen an oval-shaped faucet. Unscrew the little piece at the end of the faucet. If the part with the threads is round, you won't have any problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you pour water into the machine instead of connecting it to the faucet?\n Answer:","completion":" you can. The machine will start as soon as enough water is in the tub. A good idea is to pour the water in an hour or so before washing. That way, you can let the clothes soak in soapy water, and they'll be easier to clean.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this machine quiet? I'm a night owl and tend to do my household chores in the wee hours. I live in an apartment--will this wake the neighbors?\n Answer:","completion":" I'd say it is quiet, I live in a small apartment, I attach the machine to my kitchen sink, when in my bedroom I cannot hear it when washing, it pulsates, when it spins, it gets a little bit more noisy, especially if, it's over loaded.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: please explain how this runs by batteries?\n Answer:","completion":" It doesn't. A lot of people ask this question because of Amazon's stupidity. If you look at the Technical Details section, you'd see this: Batteries Included? Yes Batteries Required? Yes Battery Cell Type NiCAD Description Pile AAA Rechargable Average Battery Life 15 hours Battery Capacity 25 milliamp_hours There are also other weird descriptors like \"200 beats per minute.\" These weird erroneous descriptions are all over Amazon. They have nothing to do with this washer. IT has to be plugged in and does not use batteries.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How well does this spin water out of clothes?\n Answer:","completion":" It does a decent job, but it will not 'nearly dry' things like jeans or hoodies. They won't be dripping wet, but they'll still be very damp. You may want to get that spinner like some others have suggested to push more water out of your heavy garments. Also, if your laundromat is nearby but you just don't want to sit around for hours waiting for your stuff, you could do a few loads in your washer, put the items in a plastic bag, and run down there to dry them (sitting in front of the dryer so no one rips you off) for a half hour or so. I make do with my HAIER and a clothesline very nicely, and am able to set up a clothes rack that can handle the laundry of two people very well during the winter months. For very heavy things, though, if I had a lot of them, I'd probably do the \"run to the laundromat and use the dryer\" trick.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you have to plug this into a wall hookup or can I set it up in my bedroom\/ or bathroom?\n Answer:","completion":" You need a drain for the water and of course an electrical outlet. We have it draining into the bathroom sink. The kitchen or bathroom would work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you put the drain line into a tub rather than into a sink drain? Is the tight fit important for drainage?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you could put it into the tub to drain. It has a hard plastic \"U\" to hang over the edge of a sink. It doesn't require a tight fit. I put it over the edge of the kitchen sink between the dish drain rack and the edge of the sink. That way, it doesn't slip off when the washer pumps out the water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the batteries for\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Penny, I too did see that in the manual, However, I contacted Haier directly, They informed me that they have manuals and most of them are in \"template\" format and for them not to \"reinvent the manual\" they tailor and modify the manual specifically to the appliance. They assured me that the Haier HLP21N Pulsator portable washer is 100% electrical with no need for batteries. They also went on to say that this machine does not keep \"memory settings\" like in there other models that do. So, in a nutshell, this was a typo left on the manual and rest assured that your washer does not need batteries for any reason. Happy Washing ! George\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I would like to know if the agitator kicks some butt on this machine or is it like all the rest...barely moves??? Thank you for your assistance.\n Answer:","completion":" It's a good machine for what's available today. I returned two of the \"new water saving\" machines that are useless, that's on the market today. Then I found this one. I LOVE this machine. It's as close to an \"older version\" washer as your going to find. The agitator works great but not like 30 years ago. It is NOT as weak as the new water and energy saving models. Those actually left stains on my clothes. This has not. Everything is clean, and I can add extra water, softener or bleach when I want to, not when the machine dictates it through a cup holder. \" I like extra bleach at times when needed. \" You wont be disappointed with this machine. It CLEANS clothes unlike the water savers today. I wish it held a larger load like the old monster sized \"heavy duty\" machines but it in fact cleans well. No bells and whistles but clean clothes and spins like the dickens so ready for the dryer. It's worth every penny !! You will NOT find a washer like the ones from 30 years ago...I already spent near a year trying. This is the next best one, and comes in second to those older models we loved so much. When it goes I will buy this same one again...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the Speed Queen AWN 432 have cold-water wash?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, It has all of the normal wash selections\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: ow much soap shall I use for one load of wash\n Answer:","completion":" I use a little less than the instructions say. This washer spins so strongly that it practically acts an an extractor, so the wash water is pretty much gone before it is even rinsed. Then it has a setting for a double rinse, which is awesome. It really gets the detergent out. I do not use HE detergent. This is the best washer ever!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is it's dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" 43 1\/2 inches to top of control panel, add another 9 1\/2 inches with the lid opened up, 28 inches deep, 25 1\/2 inches wide.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the tub fill with water for the rinse cycle or does it spray the clothes with water to rinse them?\n Answer:","completion":" The more I hear about the new high efficiency washers, the more I love my Speed Queen. Yes, the tub of my washer fills with lots of water, lots and lots of water. AND, if you want to add even more, you just turn the dial. Novel concept.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have a cabinet above where the washer will be. What is the total distance from the floor to the top edge of the lid when it is open? I want to be able to open the lid without it hitting the cabinet.\n Answer:","completion":" Between 52 & 53 inches. ( I have mine on rubber casters, so it is difficult to give a precise measurement.)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I know the washer has a manual override where you hold the knob so it will fill to the top. Do you have to hold the knob to fill on rinse too?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. What I do sometimes is I just use the extra rinse feature rather than wait for the rinse and to hold the button down. I think there is an entry on these comments about how to alter the machine so it will fill to the top line on an extra large load. I have not done this to my machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: DOES IT RINSE IN COLD WATER\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. The only option is a cold rinse.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this washer have computers in it Does it have and agitator\n Answer:","completion":" No computers!! Yes, it has an agitator.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it share the same template (duct cutout size) as the older model #56?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure what the model # was on the one that we replaced, but it was old -- most likely original to the house which was built in 1979. All we had to do was drill a couple new holes to mount it over where the old one had been. Very easy!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this controller work with the Aprilaire 600M?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not 100%, but it seems to me that it will. There is simple (and i mean not very discriptive) instructions with it. This unit 600M may require a transformer in the electrical loop. mine did. I had to get a doorbell transformer from homedepot. If you dont have one, you might as well order one of those too. Just a simple electrical loop and this humidistat is the switch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this humidistat work with a Totaline P110-LBP2417 humidifier??\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure re compatability. The humidstat is just a relay to a solenoid. In theory, you are just connecting power on the poles of this relay and the ground line goes from the solenoid right to the power supply. I replaced a bryant humidstat with this one and it worked fine - if that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with my Lennox Healthy Climate - Model WB@ - 17?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Humidistat keeps blowing my furnace breaker. Is this a bad humidistat? Turned to off and the furnace works and water keeps flowing to aprilaire.\n Answer:","completion":" This humidistat runs off 24V AC and often has it's own step down power supply when the blower board doesn't support it. Check if you are getting 24V AC coming up to the humidistat. The solenoid for the water should be closed unless the blower motor comes on. The transformer is hooked directly at the blower board for aux power 115V. Check your manual for the diagram. If it's blowing the breaker, the blower board is probably detecting a problem with the step down transformer 115 to 24 AC. I'd be checking there. The humidistat acts like a light switch and that's just a simple circuit, open or closed. When you turn the knob you can hear it click, that's opening and closing the circuit to directly to the water solenoid. If the solenoid is stuck open, the solenoid is probably blown.

{"prompt":"Question: I'm just wondering where the actual squeak sound comes from? Is it possible that it's doing any permanent damage inside the machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, Chris. With dryers, a squeak is almost always a sign of damage being done. The only possible exception is if your bearing needs only grease, which means damage is being done but slowly. In order, the three typical places to look for a dryer squeak are: the tension wheel (which holds the belt tight around the drum), the front of the drum (which usually rides on a plastic collar behind the front panel of the dryer, though sometimes rides on two wheels underneath), and, of course, the bearing behind the center of the drum. Usually the cause is obvious. If it's not obvious, it's usually the bearing. Try greasing it if nothing else seems to be the problem. Best of luck.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I purchased this filter on 12\/31\/14. Now there are black particle in water. What's happened. Defect products?\n Answer:","completion":" Unfortunately, I think I do know the source of your problem. In August last year I purchased three filters from a vendor on Amazon. When I received them I noticed a few aspects that were different. The caps were red not blue; the filters were shrink wrapped rather than the usual cardboard container and; there were product information sheets enclosed. I contacted the vendor and he offered to accept the filters in return and refund the purchase. Since he seemed willing to stand behind his product, I kept the filters. About 5 weeks later I needed to replace the filter. When I installed the new one and tried to flush water through it I discovered the same phenomenon that you describing: I believe what both you and I saw is activated charcoal which being released. I would return the filter immediately. I was impressed with the integrity of the vendor that sold me the defective filters (I think the company name was something like Tune to Music). I emailed them immediately after installing the defective filter. He responded immediately by crediting my charge card and saying I did not need to return the filters. He explained that they were purchased from a supplier that for other reasons he was no longer affiliated with. I assumed that he got burned with defective merchandise from that vendor but made good on our transaction! In the past these filters had been in stock at Amazon and I never had a problem with them. When I replaced the defective filters, I again ordered from Amazon and the vendor actually filling the order was AtoZSales. The filters were LG OEM and exactly what I expected!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this work with standard kegs?\n Answer:","completion":" It's hard to answer this question because I do not recall what the \"description\" said when I purchased this product last fall. However, the item(s) I received when I purchased this DO work for a standard keg that you would buy at a liquor store for a party (sanke keg is the technical term I think?). But now as I read the description it specifies \"ball lock\" is included which makes me believe it would only work on corny kegs (old pop kegs used for home brewing...) which is what I use this for. I just needed to spend an extra $10 on the ball lock assembly to convert it. However if you WANTED a party keg attachment instead of ball lock, (assuming the description is correct and you DO receive ball locks) I'm not sure how much that would cost in addition. Not sure if this helps at all, but 6 months ago when I bought this I received a party-keg set up.. Haven't used it for a party keg yet but sure is nice to have the option I guess.\n"}

Here it is http:\/\/www.iccsafe.org\/Pages\/default.aspx\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the booster have to be in a certain pos to run\n Answer:","completion":" If I understand the question (pos meaning position), the unit has rubber feet so I believe it is intended to be upright when running. If you are wondering if it can be installed anywhere along the discharge line from the dryer exit to where the line exits the house, I would guess it would work where you want to install it. You do need power close enough to the electric cord with is probably close to 6 feet. I would suggest installing close to the dryer, if only do you know if it is running when the dryer is on.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this have a vacuum switch that automatically turns the motor on when the dyer turns on?\n Answer:","completion":" The device runs on a pressure switch that senses increased air pressure in the exhaust line when the dryer comes on.

I've read comments where some customers had to install wood supports.\n Answer:","completion":" As long as you can anchor to at least one stud and then used heavy duty drywall anchors for the other attachment points you should be ok.

{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone purchased this oven recently?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased one about three years ago. I have had absolutist no problems with it and I love it. If you are a serious cook, you will love it as well. I love the way I can control the heat of the range and I believe it rivals any gas cook top. I would much prefer the cook top of this range to a gas cook top as the solid surface is easy to maintain, it has warning signals if something boils over and nothing heats up if a pan is not on the surface. I have a very powerful microwave and have done a head to head comparison of bringing water to a boil. This range beats the microwave hands down. In fact, your cooking style will change due to the rapid pace of heating. I love the control I have when making heat sensitive dishes such as gravies, stove top custards and dishes that require high control of heat. The first couple weeks I kept calling my wife over to look at how much better things were cooking up. The ovens are excellent as well. I have not used the lower oven much at all but it would be handy if you are cooking for a large group or need to keep something warm while something else occupies the large oven. Some cool unexpected things regarding this oven is it can be used as a food dryer as well as to proof bread (low heat for yeast breads to rise). The oven has more controls than any mere mortal would ever use. It actually has certain modes for some religious holidays; not making that up. I have seen no downside to the ovens. They are awesome. After three years of use, I truly see no down side to this range at all. I understand that there is a range out there now that will heat a pan no matter where it is placed on the surface. I guess that would be cool but probably would not change the way I cook at all. I highly suggest this range. It would get 6 stars on a 5 star scale.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I currently have a stand alone range. Can the slide in work in the same 30\" slot in the kitchen counter?\n Answer:","completion":" Maybe. If you have flat counters like granite then it might work. The edge if your counter may need to be flat and not curve up too. There may be accessories to accommodate the curve but you'd have check on electrolux's website. There should be a fitment guide pdf guide there. The main concern is the slide in is designed slide over the counter so its nearly flush with the counter. If you have tile with a round edge on the left and right if the stove you won't be able to get the stove top flat with the counters and it won't look right. Even if you satisfy the flat countertop requirement, you will ideally want a small strip of countertop behind the stove to fill the gap between the backsplash and the back of the stove. Slide in ranges are designed to look like counter top stoves and the trim piece on the stove is designed to be flush with the countertop on 3 sides (left, behind, right). Although I've seen optional accessories for placing a \"dummy\" filler piece behind the stove to fill the gap on back, you'd have to check the website or ask an appliance retailer. With all that being said, I would just buy the Electrolux free standing induction version if that is the stove\/counter configuration you have now. It will be a direct replacement. Check electrolux's website.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I purchase a warranty for this product?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased an extended warranty through Sears. We love the stove. It is an outstanding product and the induction technology is amazing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to use the built in cooking timer\n Answer:","completion":" it's a little weird. There are two of them, one above the other. just touch it and type the minutes then either touch it again or his start, I forget. It will not shut off the oven, it's just a timer and it's not that loud. I prefer the one on my iphone.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How can we repair the E15 error code?\n Answer:","completion":" I had the E15 problem. The range would do nothing but beep in an annoying tone. E15 is not something that most owners can take care of. I called the tech from Sears, who replaced a circuit board and it started working again. The way it looks, E15 can be caused by a range of issues. Only a qualified tech can find out the real problem, and fix it. As I have said before, purchase the extended warranty for this range - chances are very high that you will need it. FWIW, this range is an absolute delight to work with when it works (That is my way of saying it is aggravating when it doesn't.)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the experience controling top heat with the touch panel (no knob)?\n Answer:","completion":" Works great, I had no problems with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have the ability to just start the dryer for a short time to help remove wrinkles in the morning if starting a load before going to bed?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the dryer portion has the option to dry after washing and rinsing or rinsing and drying without the wash. But it also has dry only which btw is by steam so it does take out wrinkles. I have not used it in this manner before as I usually wash, rinse and dry. Oh, it also does have a wash\/rinse without drying for things that you would need to hang dry. It is a pretty sweet unit and have not had any proplems after two years.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with hose\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it came with everything needed to set it up; even a special wrench to work specifically on the set up of the combo. The only extra thing you'll need to make sure you have on-hand is the HE (high efficiency) detergent. Oh, and dryer sheets don't work; you'll need a liquid softener if you use the stuff.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be portable like the 2.7 model with its extra weight?\n Answer:","completion":" No, I think it's way too large to be called portable. Also, it needs stability or it vibrates badly. Got to tell you I love the machine though!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This looks like a great washer\/dryer combo: But is it vented or not?\n Answer:","completion":" Have read about these & would love to get one. I live in an old house (100+yrs) & I'm concerned about: 1.) the need for a level floor, and 2.) more importantly, the amount of vibration. I can just imagine the whole house shaking. Does anyone have experience or suggestions dealing with either issue?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the inside diameter of the dain line?\n Answer:","completion":" 7\/8 inch\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be programmed to wash and then dry? Meaning if I set it to wash &amp; dry when I leave, will it be dry when I return? Or do I have to set it to dry after wash cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you can program it to immediately dry after the wash cycle is done.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this combo have to be installed in a drain pan. Does all of the water discharged from the washer go out the hose or is a secondary drain required\n Answer:","completion":" No. It drains through the drain hose into a drain pipe just like a regular washer. This includes the dryer condensate. The only time you will have water POSSIBLY draining onto the floor would be when cleaning the filter. About a quart of water drains from the filter. I use a large rond pan that is about 1 1\/2 inches high to catch that water when I clean the filter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long during the washer and dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" From the time I put in load to taking out dry anywhere between 1 1\/2 - 3 hours, depending on cycle.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: With the door open, what is the height from the bottom of the opening in the front of the dryer to the floor?\n Answer:","completion":" 15.5 inches from floor to bottom of opening.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this dryer have a steam dry capability to remove wrinkles?\n Answer:","completion":" No but you can somewhat duplicate this function by running a quick wash cycle (set SOIL LEVEL to light) with drying. I've done this. Or you can run a dry-only cycle with a wet towel inside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: WHAT IS THE WATTAGE?\n Answer:","completion":" 20 watt\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this correct bulb for GE Spacemaker XL1800 microwave\n Answer:","completion":" This is the correct bulb but be warned, they are packaged very poorly. When the (2) bulbs I ordered arrived they were both in a small plastic ziplock bag without separation, causing damage to one and thus unusable.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this item a genuine GE part because I ordered it before and was not the right fit and not GE\n Answer:","completion":" So, I quick checked the replacement I purchased on Amazon and there were no markings specifying a branding. However, I checked it against my other burner assembly (the one which is original to my oven) and it is exactly identical to the original (similar markings on the bottom with 2-two digit numbers and the same notches, circles, etc). Just a word of advice as far as purchasing this...I can see a number of sellers on this page currently. Amazon would not sell a product with GE labeling without it actually being a GE product. You should be safe if you buy it directly from Amazon as a seller. I bought mine from Amazon and have been very happy with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this for a self-cleaning oven? It looks like the right one, but then I noticed in a description of another element that it specified self cleaning.\n Answer:","completion":" From what I've seen\/read an element is an element!

For the money diffference on the GE site I think it's worth the gamble, not an expert but my guess this is probably the same unit. Just be careful not to let the electrical wire connectors retract into the holes! Hey! if I could install it you can too! Good Luck!!!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What else do I need to buy besides a Keg in order to get this up and running? (i.e. CO2 tank, Keg interface)\n Answer:","completion":" You will need to fill the co2 tank. Personally I ended up switching out everything on it a couple of months down the road and just kept the fridge and the mount for the tap. Remember to put a cheap fan in the back of the fridge to keep the air flow going or else it will only get temps of about 45%.\n"}

Also i've heard some people talking about putting a fan inside, where would i...\n Answer:","completion":" Never measured the temperature; I just put a keg inside and it cools the beer perfectly. Are you measuring with a keg in or out? It's designed to work with a keg in it, and the keg itself will help retain the cold because it's metal...\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What type of faucet do you need to buy so the one-faucet hook-up will fit? Is there a piece you can buy to screw into your existing faucet? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. The washer comes with the necessary faucet adapter. However, your faucet must have a removable aerator so that you can remove the one that comes with the faucet and screw the adapter in so you can plug the hose in. Some faucets have non-removable aerators and can't take the adapter.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Up to what size diam pot can i use on the medium sized burner?\n Answer:","completion":" The plates\/burners work with pots that are about 50% of their size and larger. So if the pot has a diam larger than the burner, only the section on the induction plate gets heated by the burner. A very large pot\/griddle that spans two burners can be heated by both burners.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have built-in downdraft ventilation?\n Answer:","completion":" no\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how much clearance below unit\n Answer:","completion":" Dear Bubby Bob, Bosch's installation manual does not mention any specific clearance below the cooktop. They recommend at least 2 inches around the sides and back of the unit and 2.24 to the front. Any cabinets above should be at least 30 inches above the surface. You may want to contact Bosch directly or you can call our sales department at1-888-768-1710 and they can call Bosch on your behalf to check on any recommendation.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do I need ventilation with an induction cooktop?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Look for range hoods on appliancehippo.com. Thank you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much electricity does this use compared to a regular electric cooktop?\n Answer:","completion":" I guess I can answer this 3 ways... (1) It should be a drop-in replacement for existing conventional cooktop; it uses 220V and 40A (or maybe 30A -- check the manual) (2) I'd guess it is slightly more efficient because it doesn't have to heat anything but the pot. There's some inefficiency in the induction mechanism, but I'd guess this is less than the inefficiency of heating the air and whatnot around a conventional electric element. (3) I wouldn't worry about your electric bill. It's not going to be noticeably different than conventional electric, and, even if you are blazing away at 6000 watts (4 burners going full) you are looking at less than $1\/hour at the worst of USA electric rates. Do the math on, say, boiling 4 quarts of water and you'll see it's a few pennies.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of pans do I need ?\n Answer:","completion":" Induction-compatible cookware contains ferromagnetic materials - in other words, it contains iron, or has a layer with magnetic properties. Cast iron, enamel cast iron and most types of stainless steel cookware are all induction compatible (But not all types - for instance, All-Clad's MC2 line, which is made of aluminum and stainless steel, is not induction compatible). Aluminum, copper or glass cookware will not work unless they have a layer on the bottom with magnetic properties. To tell if a pot or pan is induction-compatible, hold a magnet to the bottom. If it clings, the cookware will work on an induction cooktop. Also, many manufacturers have started putting a n \"induction compatible\" symbol on the bottom of their cookware or they'll note compatibility on their packaging. The symbol often looks like a horizontal zig-zag or a coil. If you have an induction cooktop, but a favorite piece of cookware doesn't work on it, don't fret - Mauviel makes a product called the Mauviel Induction Disc (Compare Prices), which can be placed on the cooktop under the pan; the heating reaction will then heat the contents of the pan. If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Goedekers and we will be more than happy to assist you. Thank you for considering Goedekers and have a wonderful weekend! Thank You, Brenna Davis brenna.davis@goedekers.com 1-888-768-1710 ext 315\n"}

Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, Our installer put a plug on the power cord instead of wiring it into the system. I added an extension cord with a power switch that I plug the Broan into. It sits in the cabinet over the Broan. I can just reach it to toggle it- then I have do some button pushing because the Broan comes up in a default mode that turns on the lights. But the noise of the fan is GONE. Good luck. Great exhaust fan and the lights are the best, but a little hard to live with. Sheila D.\n"}

If they didn't do that, it would be tough to get them out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I love mine but one of the lights keeps burning out why?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased my Broan on July 5, 2013. I have yet to replace the bulbs and they usually stay on all night. I purchased the bulbs here on Amazon but cant find them here anymore. I can only think that one port is tossing out to much power and causing it to pop. I had the same problem with an outdoor light. I would need to replace them monthly. I ended up buying higher end Cree bulbs and it has been close to 2 years without replacing them. Try buying one good bulb and see if it lasts. Good luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do you have to order the conversion kit separately or does it come with it?\n Answer:","completion":" Everything I needed came with my order.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: cfm*\n Answer:","completion":" Your question is rather non-sensical. Are you using the hood ducted, or non-ducted? At what height over the burners will it be mounted 24-25-26-27-28-29, or 30\"? How many BTUs are produced on your cooking surface? How many CFM at which speed, there are 3? My unit works perfectly well, non-ducted, using the specified charcoal filters (which reduce air flow, and are not included) over my six burner induction stove. The unit is NOT commercial quality but is quite high end for a residential hood. The installation was not difficult - the unit has worked flawlessly for 3 months.\n"}

What is the replacement number that I need?\n Answer:","completion":" The best course of action is to go to the Samsung website and get the exact specifications of the drawer you need from there.

The Sabbath feature may only be used with the BAKE pad. The oven temperature may be set higher or lower after setting the Sabbath feature (the oven temperature adjustment feature should be used only during Jewish Holidays), however the display will not visibly show or provide any audible tones indicating whether the change occurred correctly. Once the oven is properly set using Bake with the Sabbath feature active, the oven will remain continuously ON until cancelled. This will override the factory preset 12-Hour Energy Saving feature. If the oven light will be needed during the Sabbath, press Oven light pad before activating the Sabbath feature. Once the oven light is turned ON and the Sabbath feature is active, the oven light will remain ON until the Sabbath feature is turned OFF. If the oven light needs to be OFF, be sure to turn the oven light OFF before activating the Sabbath feature. IMPORTANT NOTES: It is not advised to attempt to activate any other program feature other than BAKE while the Sabbath feature is active. ONLY the following key pads will function after setting the Sabbath feature; UP or DOWN ARROW, BAKE, START & CLEAR\/OFF pads. ALL OTHER KEYPADS will not function once the Sabbath feature is properly activated. To Program the Oven to Begin Baking Immediately & activate the Sabbath feature 1. Be sure that the clock is set with the correct time of day. 2. Place the food in the oven. 3. Press Bake pad. \"---\" will appear, \"UPPER\" and \"bake \" will flash in the display. 4. Press the Up or Down arrow pad until the desired temperature appears. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" will flash in the display. 5. Press Start pad or wait 5 seconds. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" stop flashing and the icon will appear in the display. 6. If you desire to set the oven control for a Timed Bake or Delayed Start Bake do so at this time. If not, skip this step and continue to step 7. Refer to the Timed Bake (complete steps 6-8) \/ Delayed Start Bake (complete steps 6-11) section for complete instructions. Remember the oven will shut down after using Timed Bake or Delay Start Bake and therefore may only be used once during the Sabbath\/Jewish Holidays. The maximum Delayed Start Bake time is 11 hours & 59 minutes. 7. The oven will turn ON and begin heating.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Last 2 filters we bought \"lasted\" almost exactly 6 months. Is our usage that consistent? Or does the change filter light come on every six months?\n Answer:","completion":" My samsung light sometime goes 7 -8 months.before lighting and we use it a lot even fill the coffee pot everyday.

We Have a large family.\n Answer:","completion":" I recently bought this Speed Queen washer and I couldn't be happier with it. I have been washing very big loads of jeans with no problem.

{"prompt":"Question: do I need to buy the 4 yr warranty since speed queen has a good warranty on their machines?\n Answer:","completion":" The factory warranty is for 3 years, so you would gain little by buying that....\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this have a stainless steel tub?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: differences in models, how well agitators work, spin speeds etc\n Answer:","completion":" I think the difference I models is the extra rinse option.

{"prompt":"Question: can i make water level go higher permanatley on new speed queen top load washer since water restrictions on new washer\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.

{"prompt":"Question: What's the Rpm on the spin cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure & don't remember seeing it in the manual. It definitely is not as fast as the new high tech machines & things do come out damper which can affect dry time. However they also don't come out as wrinkled or tangled. Energy wise I don't see a real negative to this as the longest wash cycle takes about &#8531; the time as the shortest wash cycle on a high tech, so the extra dry time prob still uses less energy overall to wash & dry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use HE laundry soap in my new Speed Queen top load washer without causing any harm?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Almost all detergent is now marked HE. We are using it in our washer and have been for weeks in our older one we just got rid of. Additionally, the new HE detergent is made to have less suds, since the new washers use less water and more enzymes to break down the dirt. So you would only need to be concerned if you had a new HE washer and put too much soap in your wash, as your clothes wouldn't be free of the soap at the end. The main thing we will all notice by using HE stamped detergent is less suds in our traditional top loader.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where can I get my co2 tank refilled for my kegerator\n Answer:","completion":" I take mine down to the local welding supply store. They have CO2, Oxygen, Propane, Butane, Acetylene, etc. I had a cool looking bottle that came with mine, silver color with black logo on the side. They would not fill it for me.

{"prompt":"Question: Is it actually in stock and can be shipped in 2 -3 days?\n Answer:","completion":" This is in stock with LG- we however do not find they can ship in 2-3 days, they generally ship in about 5. But if you can wait a few extra days you can save a lot of money! Melanie with Goedekers\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this unit be hung flush on a wall surface?\n Answer:","completion":" It \"could\" be adapted to hang on a wall. There are no prefab openings in the wood to hang on wall mounts. The real intent is for it to sit on a flat surface such as a shelf or table.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the case made out of wood?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It looks nice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you hang this on a wall?\n Answer:","completion":" It was not designed to be hung on the wall, but you could probably do it if you add your own brackets.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do you adjust the Barometer? It say adjust before use-See instructions!! There are no instructions!!\n Answer:","completion":" Jack, I emailed the manufacture and they sent some instructions. This is what they sent to me: To set your barometer please follow these instructions: 1. Get an accurate barametric pressure reading from your weather service or airport. 2. Turn the adjustment screw, if you need to, to the barometer to the reading of your weather station. 3. There are two needles. One that automatically follows the changes in atmospheric pressure while the other one remains fixed until moved by hand. 4. Set the movable dail by hand to coincide with the needle marking the current pressure. 5. Watch for the needle that follows the pressure changes to move up or down from that fixed point. Tap the barometer lightly before taking the reading. 6. Compare the readings to the weather reports and other reports of barometric pressures in your area to confirm the accuracy of your unit. I hope this helps!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what replacement water filter replacement\n Answer:","completion":" Samsung Water filter part # DA29-0002B\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What voltage is the item\n Answer:","completion":" 115 Volts AC\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Which is better for delicates and to get out Stains, this or a Manual Washboard?? Will a washboard wear out my clothes but get them cleaner?\n Answer:","completion":" The MobileWasher's delicate cycle generates it's power from precise wrist action. While cocking the wrist and utilizing a \"GI Joe\" type hand grip the user can accurately desoil most fine fabrics. Heavier soiling however requires a looser, more modified dual wrist action that is best used in combination with a \"Kung foo\" style grip. Full on elbow motion only enhances the efficiency on this stain setting. An open leg stance with hip sway AND full back arching are required to attain a vigorous agitation cycle. In either case, this washer's shaft is sturdy, rock hard, smooth and comfortable to grip. This alone easily separates it from the barbarian like action of a washboard, thus making it an efficient, caring washer for all your filthy fabrics.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use it in a clean utility sink? (Laundry sink) It seems like that would be easy to drain and refill for rinsing, but is it too big?\n Answer:","completion":" Are you asking if the sink is too big? I don't think so - seems some folks just use the bathtub! I measured the plastic tub I use (which I put in the bathtub) - it is a 12\"x17\" rectangle that is 12\" deep. I can wash a load of undies, or a couple shirts and slacks or a queen sheet in the tub without even filling it clear up. I would think if you use a laundry sink, which might be bigger, you would just keep the water more shallow. You can tell when you have the water high enough to plunge the clothes around easily. In fact, I was just reading the newer reviews here and I like the idea of putting a laundry basket inside the washing tub so you can lift out the clothes to empty the water. You could certainly do that inside a laundry tub! Also, I just did a couple loads yesterday and am still enjoying the mobile washer - short handle and all. My handle has not loosened, but I'm sure I can fix it if it does. I really do like this device - it keeps my inner hippy chick alive in my social security aged body!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you use this portable washing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" You simply put your dirty clothes in a sink, tub or bucket with a small amount of water and detergent (enough to cover them), place the MobileWasher on top of them and move it up and down. After a few minutes when the clothes are clean you put them in clean water and repeat the up and down motion in order to rinse the dirty water and detergent out. Do a quick search on Youtube and you'll find a number of how-to videos.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you dry your clothes after using this? Do you ring them dry with your hands and then hang them?\n Answer:","completion":" Hanging them outside to dry is the best way. A mechanical wringer would get them dry enough for an automatic dryer, but good ones are not cheap or readily available. While hand-wringing sort of works on woven fabrics, it's not a good idea for knits because they get stretched out of shape. Debbie is right about the dripping, and it's hard to wring heavy fabrics like denim jeans. Knit sweaters and tops can be squeezed to get much of the water out, and if you wrap a clean dry towel around them you can squeeze out even more, then hang the towel to dry with the rest of the laundry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this really easier and\/or more effective than just agitating the laundry with your hands or stomping with your feet?\n Answer:","completion":" If you only have a couple of small items such as underwear, it is just as easy to use your hands. However, if you have larger items such as sheets, towels, and regular clothing it is easier and more efficient with the MobileWasher. I absolutely love mine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How big a bucket should be to use this washer? Of course bucket... (This was auto correction.... which annoys me)\n Answer:","completion":" I have two buckets that I believe are 3 gallon size. It does work in them, and since I am using them to wash cloth diapers it helps me to keep the number lower to clean, but I think a 5 gallon bucket would be better. I highly recommend this washer. I use it to prewash the diapers since our machine is an HE type--low water and diapers does NOT mix--but have also used it on other items that I needed without wanting to do a full machine load and it was great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm thinking of doing this in my bathtub. Could I rig it with a broom stick for length? I have a bad back.\n Answer:","completion":" Does your broomstick have a screw thread? Because you need to screw the stick into the cone. The circumference of the thread from the stick it comes with is 2 & 3\/8 inches. The width and space between each thread is 1\/8 inch. I tried it in the bathtub and it does not work as well as in the 5 gallon bucket. Actually, you will do more energy work in the bathtub. In the bucket, you don't use as much energy and the MobileWasher is more powerful with the suction and pushing air and water through the clothes to make them very clean, better than the washer machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone have a copy of the instruction sheet?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know about instructions. Just be aware that a small amount of detergent is enough. Two or three small pieces of clothing is plenty. A five gallon paint bucket is fine. Just agitate to your hearts content. Use lots of water for rinsing. A little fabric softener in the final rinse works ok. One item at a time is ideal but not water wise. It works in a pinch but no blankets and sheets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 1) Where can I get free water bucket? 2) Should I get a prop 65 bucket that I seen at a 99 cents store? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Yes any bucket will work as long as it is wider than a plunger. But you can often get the buckets at menards, lowes, home depo, walmart or even grocery stores that have deli you can ask the manager sometimes they will give them to you or sell them dirt cheap.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How is this better than just using a regular plunger?\n Answer:","completion":" It works better and more simply. We tried a regular plunger and it just didn't compare.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: door locked ,why won't it open or run?\n Answer:","completion":" is it still running...if the lights are on, it is...unplug it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Machine bounces around during spin cycle although it is levelled. Why and how can we stop this?\n Answer:","completion":" You cannot and it will cause the rubber bellow to tear. Use less clothes per wash only way to make the machine last. Its a horrible product.\n"}

Not a problem\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How has this refrigerator been working out for you? Any regrets?\n Answer:","completion":" couldn't be better. If I had one complaint it is that the ice maker takes up 1\/4 of the freezer space. It does work very well though. We just bought a little chest freezer at Costco for about $160 and that solved our need for more freezer space. Other than that it is quiet as a mouse and works perfect. I recommend it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will this part work for Model LE7810XPN0?\n Answer:","completion":" there should be some old numbers on the old element, and there should be numbers here you cross over to this number. You may have to do a search elsewhere for the cross reference numbers, but if you put the numbers from your old element in a search, it should lead you to if this will work.

{"prompt":"Question: Does it fit on kenmore washer series 90?\n Answer:","completion":" Possibly....but the best way to ensure it's correct is to get the model number off of the washer then go to www.searspartsdirect.com and find the part number for the pump. The model number is located on a tag just under the lid at the back of the washer. An alternative would be to pull the old part and get the number off of it. For what it's worth I installed this on an 80 series.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with the two clips to attach it?\n Answer:","completion":" No. You have to use existing clips or find them online or at an appliance store.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of warrenty does this part have? I bought this part on 10\/25\/14 and it has a crack in the plastic that has started to leak water.\n Answer:","completion":" We bought two, both of which immediately began leaking from the top. (Which was our problem to begin with.) We paid so little for the part, (under $20) that we didn't bother with the return. What we did was put glue on the top which was leaking and it has worked just fine. Its been about 3 months.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it fit a 70 series model? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" The best thing to do is to remove the one from the washer and compare it with The one that you want to buy that's what I did.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do you install it to get it watertight? Looked for youtube videos - no luck!\n Answer:","completion":" You just shove the water line in, easy as that, it's amazing. I've used about 6 of them and they all work perfectly, no drips. Its a snug fit but there's more to it than that. The openings are actually tapered like a funnel, just ever so slightly, and it also has a spring loaded mechanism that prevents the tubing from being pulled out accidentally. If you do however need to remove the already in-place water line simply press down firmly on the spring loaded collar ( you'll see what I'm talking about once you have it in your hands of you decide to but it) and gently pull out on the water line simultaneously. It's magical :)\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work on a Kenmore coil range\/stove? Will it actually prevent white area around the element from discolouration when canning?\n Answer:","completion":" My stove is a brand new Kenmore. It fits perfectly, it does not over heat around the element and the stove is protected from my big canner sitting on it with the excess heat. I love it! I am going to buy a 2nd for the other big burner to cann on.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I know which one will fit my stove and work properly?\n Answer:","completion":" This fits all stoves, except GE and Hotpoint, which have special connections and are harder to find and usually costs over $100. I had a GE so researched this thoroughly and could not afford to put that kind of money out. Now I have a Kenmore (basically a Whirlpool) and this generic one works great and affordable too!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Our stove is a Frigidaire? Will this element work on it?\n Answer:","completion":" The box lists Frigidaire on it. It has the two prong connection.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this burner fit a GE oven Model JB650DFCC?\n Answer:","completion":" I found your model on the GE website and it is a smooth top range. This canner element is for a range that has individual elements that you can put in and take out. According to what I saw on the website, your range comes with a large burner and a hot burner, so it will probably work for canning unless the manual says not to use it for canning. If you want a separate canner element, look up hot plates for canning on Amazon. Some have good reviews.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a GE Spectra electric stove......will this fit my appliance? If so, I'm buying TWO!!!\n Answer:","completion":" the one i bought fits most stoves but will not fit GE. Check with Range Kleen who made my element. They have a websight\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a small Hotpoint tove and the picture looks JUST like my element. will this fit my stove??\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see Hotpoint listed on the box.

{"prompt":"Question: what are the dimensions of the oven?\n Answer:","completion":" The Home Depot site gives every possible bit of data incl. inside, outside, cutout size etc. Go to: http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/t\/203716503?productId=203716503&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&cm_mmc=SEM|THD|D29A&skwcid=TC|14688|ew27mc65js||S|e|28749482142&mid=s7XwqxTrA_mtid_8903tb925190_pcrid_28749482142_pkw_ew27mc65js_pmt_e&gclid=CLiZkZj8kLcCFWbhQgodsXQA3Q#.UY_A_7VwpyQ If you can't click on the link I posted, just go to HD's site and enter the model number in their search box. I believe Electrolux also makes the same oven in a 30\" model. We were replacing an elderly oven and couldn't have gone with anything wider w.o. major cabinet rebuilding. Our cabinets were\/are in excellent condition. Wife still raves about her oven racks on ball bearings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I've got it attached, but it puts out a LOT of foam. First beer was nothing but foam; no liquid beer at all. I can't see how to adjust it.\n Answer:","completion":" To me it sounds like there is no problem with the faucet itself, but maybe the beer is over carbonated if you force carbonated your beer or your serving pressure may be too high. I'd try turning off the co2 and purging the keg, then reset the pressure from about 5-10 psi and go from there. If the beer ends up being over carbonated, I'd purge the pressure off again and let it sit without any pressure on it for a day or two and see if it mellows out any.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just hooked mine up for the first time and beer is spraying everywhere out of the holes where the faucet screws onto the shank. Any thoughts?\n Answer:","completion":" Chek the black oring, it must be not as it should be, do you have the faucet tool?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This looks like pretty solid metal tap. It does not look as though it is easily opened &amp; closed by one hand. How do you actually use it?\n Answer:","completion":" It works fine with one hand, but you need an additional part: either a hand pump (\"picnic pump\") or a CO2 source. One or the other is required to pressurize the keg, after which tipping the handle is easily done with one hand while the other holds the cup.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I tried to plug the cooktop but it gives me a scary spark. Why? What should I do? Any customer service available in the Honolulu area?!?\n Answer:","completion":" Please call SPT customer support for assistance. The phone number is 800-330-0388 and the office hours are from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm Pacific Time Monday through Friday.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the heat generated to the pan placed on the ceramic surface Only and Not to any other stainless steel things around but not in touch with it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the heat will only transfer to the pan that is placed on the unit. There has to be direct contact for the heat to transefer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I set this up as free standing is it safe for a renter to use would it be safer to build it in\n Answer:","completion":" It is made to be used built-in or free-standing so as long as you use it according to the manufacturer's instructions, you will be fine. I use mine as free-standing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Want to drop into my counter top. My counter is 29\" wide and want to know if 2 will sit within 29\" side by side? Do nOT want counter top model.\n Answer:","completion":" We put it in countertop on our boat. It was less then 29 inches. It is pretty close to the dimensions listed. The whole is smaller than the top because it tapers. I love this cooktop so far. Heats up super fast on high so be careful to watch it if you use the high setting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many amps,and does this sit on top of counter if so what is cut out?Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I am copying the specification from the instructions that came with it : Voltage 120V ~\/60Hz (it does not say the Amps but probably 15?) , power consumption 1300W (max) , dimension 11.625 L x 15 W x 2.25H in., power range 100~1300 W, temperature range 100 F ~ 390 F, cord length 4ft. Cut out is 10-14\/16 wide x 14-4\/16 long (the cut out is just half inch smaller all around the cooktop). I have had for a few months now and loving it! Looks great, functions great, good price too. Definitely recommended!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: it says built in. At 2.25\"h - 0.75\"h granite top - 0.437\"above counter = 1.063\" below countertop, but it instructs to leave 4\" around for air. How??\n Answer:","completion":" Please call SPT customer support for assistance. The phone number is 800-330-0388 and the office hours are from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm Pacific Time Monday through Friday.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this be safe built in countertop over stainless steel dishwasher leaving 2\" of space in between? will it heat only pan and not dishwasher?\n Answer:","completion":" The SR-963T cooktop must have at least 7\" of space underneath it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: repairs\n Answer:","completion":" I had the same problem and went on line and found there are several yahoo.tube and I think some YouTube videos that show how to do get to the chopper to unclog, repair, or replace it. It's not too involved and even if your mechanical abilities are moderate, you should be OK. If you are a total klutz then pay the repair guys or replace the unit. And if you are fairly good at that stuff it should take between 15 and 30 minutes. In any case no previous dishwasher knowledge is necessary. I learned that one thing that wrecks the chopper is paper (usually from paper labels on jars or containers). It gets partially disintegrated from the water and soap and as the paper bits go through the chopper they ball up which get between the blades and push them off the shaft. Good luck. BTW: KithenAid, Kenmore, and Whirlpool dishwashers are all made by Whirlpool. The interiors of all those units appear to be the same with the same repair procedures.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: May I know the made of origin?\n Answer:","completion":" My Kitchen Aid dish washer is made by Whirlpool, I assume they all are. In terms of where they are made, I don't know for sure but believe they are made in the US.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the wine glass holders work well? Is it gentle on china?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the wine glass holders didn't work well for us. A couple failed (as did another plastic part), and they rapidly lost their flex. It was very gentle on china - we've absolutely no complaints there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I haven't gotten this yet but can someone tell me how to do just a rinse and hold\n Answer:","completion":" There is no \"rinse and hold\" function on the similar model KUDS30FXSS. Also, even small bits of food clog the filter, so I would recommend rinsing before loading. Actually, I would recommend not buying kitchenaid, as I've had to have mine repaired 3 times in 2 years.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you run this unit without a water filter\n Answer:","completion":" I do not think you can. You can buy filters fairly cheap. Search on internet. Do you have the in-refrigerator ice maker? If so does it work? Mine quit few days after warranty-expiration. Piece of junk.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What adjustment is needed to make the ice dispenser not snap open and shut immediately dispensing no ice...?\n Answer:","completion":" This refrigerator has a defective ice maker. There is a class action lawsuit in effect for it. You can probably find it on line. Frigidaire is made by Electrolux and they have very similar unit that is also in the suit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The upper ice maker drips water through the door dispenser. Repair service has put seals all around the ice maker twice. How do you get this fixed?\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't. I replaced this sub-standard fridge with an LG.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: control panel for ice reads 1c with E in upper right handcorner\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know what that means but the icemaker in this refridgerator is the worst in every way. Mine is 2 years old and I can't tell you how many times the repair people have been to my house to try and fix it. Even when it works it barely makes enough ice for a two person household.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will not dispense water thru door?\n Answer:","completion":" Assuming you don't have a problem with the water supply to the refrigerator and the filter is clean, the water line is probably frozen. It runs behind the ice maker mechanism and that section is known to ice up. It's a known issue and part of the myriad of issues with this unit that go wrong.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: fan ices up stops working in ice maker model fghb2866pf2\n Answer:","completion":" I have no clue. I assume you have ice maker in fridge. Mine quit working a few days after warranty expired. After a little research, I find that many have problems with this ice maker. Frigidaire response, \"TOUGH\". I did find ice in the fan. No idea why. Used a hair dryer to melt it. I do not use the ice maker anymore.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone had a problem with the front of the crisper drawer coming off? where do you find a replacement drawer for this model?\n Answer:","completion":" No problem with crisper. Has anyone had problems with ice maker in fridge, not in freezer. Mine is a piece of junk.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does fridge dispensed water smell and taste bad?\n Answer:","completion":" May need to change filter. I have this piece of crap fridge. Ice maker quit working right after warranty expired. Ice maker is a well known problem to Frigidaire and they will not do anything. Better of buying cheap brand with old type ice maker.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: There is no ice coming out of the door dispenser and I can't pull out the ice bin. It seems stuck, or is there a latch that I need to pull or press?\n Answer:","completion":" Couple of things here...........It sounds like you did not use the ice maker regularly. Is there ice in the tray? Is the door dripping from melting ice? Does that tray appear heavy, if yes there is ice in the tray. If there is ice in the tray then it is likely a solid piece of ice has formed, preventing the tray from sliding out or jammed in the door.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: if there is water leaking from dispenser what do you do?\n Answer:","completion":" Long term I have not heard of an actual fix that works to make this refrigerator's ice maker reliable. That is why I have joined the class action suit mentioned in earlier posts. Short term this is what I did. I shut off the ice maker, defrosted the ice maker section with a blow dryer (to speed up the defrosting of the ice buildup in the back.) In my case I had ice build up in the back of the unit which caused it to malfunction. I used towels to sop up the water as it melted. This became tedious as it kept recurring. We have hardwood floors and can't baby sit the refrigerator every second so I bit the bullet and bought a new refrigerator (Samsung, which I LOVE). The Frigidaire is a horror show.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where is this item made?\n Answer:","completion":" They are made in China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: this ice maker builds a yellowish mass and have to be cleaning the inside. I guess I have to buy a water calcium filter, which one should I buy?\n Answer:","completion":" I have no problem with this on my ice machine. I have an in line pre filter that takes all the impurities out of the water before it reaches the ice machine. Any inline water filter from your local hardware store should do the trick.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size are the cubes?\n Answer:","completion":" Inch squares\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this unit be placed in an outdoor kitchen that isn't fully enclosed?\n Answer:","completion":" I am using our unit indoors with AC. I can't answer your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is it to clean the mold?\n Answer:","completion":" I never got any mold. If I did I would wipe down with a sponge and some bleach\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this unit loud? Is it good for indoor install?\n Answer:","completion":" No it is not loud. You can here it running but acceptable. I have it installed in my basement bar and love it. I only turn it on when I am having company. This unit will require a floor drain or condensate pump. Very happy with the unit. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am buying this pump but I may need an additional part or two. Before the pump started leaking (it still works) it spun off balance pretty loudly and didn't wring the clothes out very well. My exact model is a Roper Stylemaster No. 4214289 rev. A. Any...\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if an out of balance condition could affect the pump but it is possible. If it is leaking at all, then replacing it is imperative. It will only get worse. Try searching the internet for a video on how to replace it. Then you will have a better idea of all the affected parts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come in it's original packaging? and is the upc 50946008387\n Answer:","completion":" If you're wondering if this is the original equipment replacement part just know it is NOT. This comes in a simple brown box simply marked with the part number. It was a perfect match for my whirlpool gold series washer. Hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit Roper model RTW4440XQ0?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, it will fit that washer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit Roper model RTW4440\n Answer:","completion":" I believe it will. Seems like they use the same style pump.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit Roper model RTW4440\n Answer:","completion":" I have a whirlpool, not sure. The item I got was misshapen and did not work, leaked badly, be careful of the supplier mine came thru amazon from Deep Discount Co.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: compatible with Kenmore model: 11026914690?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine was a whirlpool, but from the video on you tube there are only 1 or 2 types total. If you tip the machine up and it looks like yours I would give it a try. Seriously only took 10 min. The you-tube video from the manufacturer was much more involved than it needed to be. Don't worry about taking the machine apart, just lay it on it's side and you will have access without having to dismantle it. Power off of course. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does shipping usually take?\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you fro contacting us. Shipping can take up to 3-7 business days, please let us know if you have any further questions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this replace a 3352293 pump?\n Answer:","completion":" As long as it says it is an exact replacement for your washer model # then it fits.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a 7ft ceiling. can I cut this to top of the chimney to fit it.\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure of your question. I found it easier to cut into the ceiling and mount it into the rafters than to cut the fan stack itself. Then I dry-walled and patched around the fan stack. The result is what I wanted. I don't think you can cut the stack without doing some major damage to the stack (i.e. bending it or creating bad cut marks), but a professional may be able to do what you want.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a 7 foot ceiling. How tall is the housing without the extension?\n Answer:","completion":" From the bottom of the vents to the top of the first housing cover is 24.5 inches. Our 8 foot ceiling uses 9 inches of the extension considering where we put the vents - 26 inches above the stove top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this range hood come with ceiling mouint hardware, and an elbow for the first turn?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, I don't know, I didn't install by myself\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you have a chimney extension for a 10' high ceiling?\n Answer:","completion":" No....I have a 1970's ceiling. Good hood for the price. Works great....I wish the fan was quieter but a quieter one would of been triple the price.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How can I order replacement leds for this unit? One burned out on me. Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" My local Home Depot says they are coming soon, but I would think this should be offered by Amazon from AKDY, so I would go back to Amazon customer service and ask them to find a provider.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I understand it only displays military time, but have had no success even setting that correctly.. Any advice..?\n Answer:","completion":" Just subtract 12...this is super nice for the price\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is LED bulb replaceable?\n Answer:","completion":" These types of LED lights are changeable only by replacing the entire light socket. Big box stores and online versions are available. I have not done any as of yet, and hope they last a long time since they are LED.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can the dryer shelf be set at different heights? I'm short and need it lower than 51\".\n Answer:","completion":" We adjusted the shelf by buying 4 hose clamps to allow the shelf to be sturdy and lower. The cost was minimal and has worked great for us. You can get them at Home Depot or Lowes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How wide and how high is this?\n Answer:","completion":" I thought the dimensions were on the description but it is 51 1\/4\" tall and 21\" deep at the base, 13 1\/2\" deep at the top and 28 1\/4\" wide.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the dryer need to be mounted to the wall or is it safe just sitting on the shelf? It doesn't shift position or fall off if not mounted to wall?\n Answer:","completion":" I've had mine just sitting on the shelf for about a year. It moves a little but it's safe!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If this is \"meant\" to be used with an Avanti dryer that's cited on amazon as being 17.3\" D, how does the the 13.5\" D top shelf support the dryer? (Note: We have the Sonya dryer that's actually 21.2\" in depth, I'm wondering if there's any way we'll be...\n Answer:","completion":" The Avanti dryer has built-in \"nut\" type openings on the bottom. The \"bolt\" legs screw into the bottom through the top shelf wires thus the dryer is mounted to the top shelf. The shelf itself is secured against the back wall so that both dryer and shelves are secure. It has worked well for us.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the stand itself have brackets to attach the stand to the wall? And if so, where exactly are the located?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't remember exactly where they're located, because I ended up selling my stand last year when I moved to another home with laundry attached - but yes, there are brackets to bolt the entire unit to the wall (all the way to the studs, I believe).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this stand fit the Sonya SYD-60E dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it's not deep enough by a few inches because that is the larger 13lb Sonya dryer. That shelf was designed for the 8.8lb Avanti dryer that is about the same size as the Sonya SYD-40E. I previously owned the Avanti and used with the stand. Now I have the Sonya SYD-60E and had to build a custom shelf in my laundry closet because this model is both taller and deeper and too big for the shelf. It does fit the smaller Sonya model SYD-40E. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this fit over a regular size washer?\n Answer:","completion":" It will fit over a small one , not a high one. You can put it over a small one and and use the shelf on top for soap. I was very pleased with this purchase.\n"}

This Supco is a pretty generic replacement for most Kenmore refrigerators made by Whirlpool. If not Amazon will take it back.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with part #646642? Kitchenaide kssc42fjs00?\n Answer:","completion":" The Supco RIM943 is the ice maker in its entirety. You can purchase a Kitchenaid Ice Maker for the KSSC42FJS00 model Refrigerator from Sears. If these 2 Ice Makers are interchangeable, I do not know.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Confirm for me if this unit will fit Whirlpool model # ET22DKK BW00?\n Answer:","completion":" This does not seem to be a correct model number. Nothing comes up on the whirlpool website for this model number. It should be on the inside of the fridge on the wall.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can the IceMagicPlus module be fitted onto this icemaker?\n Answer:","completion":" i have no idea.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: if it appears F06 and E02 how do you know why it means?\n Answer:","completion":" There's several possibilities. Google 'Whirlpool Duet and those codes and you may find an answer. There's also a YouTube video that might help. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My paddles on the inside two of the three are missing would that make it leak whirlpool duet front loader\n Answer:","completion":" No it's not going to leak, but it the drum will be off balance and the bearings will go next. This model is pure junk. Hope you bought the warranty..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Whirlpool duet paddles are missing on the inside would that make it leak\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know about that. We did not have leaking, rather the drainline was constantly getting clogged. We replaced this washer with another brand after 2 1\/2 years due to ongoing problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What problems are you having with you Whirlpool Duet GHW9250MT1 washing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Bellows repeated wears out, causing leaks and a difficult repair to deplace a $100 part. 4 times now in 5 years. Design flaw . Should be replaced or there should be a class action suit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to remove front of washer to get to pump\n Answer:","completion":" There is no easy way. You will need to disassemble the whole machine. In my opinion they are junk. You also need to replace the bearing. That be next thing that go out. More info Utube videos.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i have this washer and was wondering if anyone else has eperienced the soap not seeming to make it to the tub. i dont see any suds in the machine!\n Answer:","completion":" It's designed to make less suds for less water usage and rinse time. Make sure you are using HE (high efficiency) detergent.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: clothes arent wet all the time. suggestions to adjust water level\n Answer:","completion":" If you haven't used a front loader before, you may be surprised at how little water it uses. Just trust the results. If you have a bulky load (like a comforter) you can use the \"bulky\" cycle, which uses a little more water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Washer won't drain. How do I locate the problem ? Model#wfw94hexw2\n Answer:","completion":" I have no idea. We've had to call a service tech out once for this machine and twice for the dryer in less than a year of ownership. They were Whirlpool preferred techs and they were reasonably priced so you may have to take that route.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I remove the front?\n Answer:","completion":" Look on Youtube. But I think you need remove everything on the inside first before you can remove the front.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: whirlpool Model #: WFW8640BW reliability\n Answer:","completion":" I can't give an accurate answer. That's not the model I own. Sorry\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is the inside light blue?\n Answer:","completion":" no\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the measurements, including the handle?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't buy it ...having issues with the unit freezing up.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you get the temperature below 37\n Answer:","completion":" With ours, any setting below 46 degrees will cause anything in the back half to freeze -- water, tea, diet drinks (with the exception would be regular soda). This probably doesn't help you if you've already bought the thing! Seems like a finicky refrigerator in general with settings, and needs to have air circulating inside it to allow the interior to be cooled equally. I would guess just from our experience that even if it's set to 37, it's much cooler toward the back than that. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this part work on my maytag wall oven?\n Answer:","completion":" As long as the original one is identical to this one ie: same label plate specs it will work\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what could replace a modern maid wall oven gas safety valve #nc-4111-5\n Answer:","completion":" y-30128-35af , however it comes standard with a natural gas orifice. It is rated for natural gas or propane. I do believe the nc-4111-5s came with a propane orifice. You would have to swap your original orifice with the one that comes on the valve ( if you have LP ) The orifice is the brass fitting that fits inside the open end of the burner tube.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My frid wall oven has valve 3203702 will this valve work for my oven\n Answer:","completion":" The only answer I can give is look at valve # 3203702 then compare it with the specs on range valve Y-30128-35A and see if it matches . I can not give any more information pertaining to your case . I will say that if the two do appear to be similar in appearance then it is a good bet that it will work . If not then it probably isn't worth the trouble to try it .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this valve for use on an LP stove\n Answer:","completion":" The valve is for use on either LP or NG but you may need to take the orifice (or nipple) off your old valve if the holes are different sizes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this part work on my Hotpoint oven?\n Answer:","completion":" There are only three things that are needed for this to work . One is the internal resistance, second is the electrical connector, and last is the mounting holes or clips . The last two can be adjusted to fit your range ( I had to use the old connector ) without any adverse effects . The internal resistance is something that can not be changed . I have been told that they are all in the same range but I can not state that as an absolute . The fact that the part is about $50 to $ 100 cheaper than what anyone else is asking is a good reason to gamble on the part . If you do not alter it in any way it can still be returned for a refund if inoperable . The only thing that might be altered is the connector that plugs into it and that is in the wiring not in the part . I would suggest that you take off the bottom pan in your oven ( normally 4 screws ) and look to see if the old part matches the one in the picture . It is not difficult and is straightforward to replace even though the instructions are a little \" sketchy \" . I hope this helps you or at least sheds some light on your question .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this part work on a kenmore oven?\n Answer:","completion":" depends on model # of the range if I had model I could let you know\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My valve reads Y-30128-35. Will this part work or will the two letters on the end prevent it? Also, they look just the same\n Answer:","completion":" Same thing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this part the same as 5303276601 safety valve? Looking to fix my Tappan oven. 76423223\/08011-85029375. Thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" I do not know if the part in question will actually work with a Tappan oven . The best answer I can give is to look at the one in your oven and see if it resembles the one pictured . They all work on the same principle and it is mostly the gas in size ( NPT thread size ) and the electrical connections that will determine if it will fit your range or not . The other determining factor is the internal resistance that triggers the valve to open but I do think that the values are the same . The best I can say is try it and see . If the original looks the same it probably is .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hello- does this part have a UL listing?\n Answer:","completion":" He'll there, I am not sure if it is UL listed or not, I only knew that I would have paid triple the amazon price of I have got it from the manufacture. I purchased it and was not even sure if it will work or for my oven type or not. I installed it and it works like a champ since then! One thing to let you be aware of, the images in Amazon has it with the wire plug included, it did not come with the plug as it show but it came with a wire replacement. I would give the actual part 5 out of 5 Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit Maytag\/Magic Chef model # 9112XUB\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if this fits Maytag. It does fit Kenmore\/Whirlpool, but I did have to change the orifice to the original as huge flames were coming out of the burner.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a genuine GE product, or by an after-market manufacturer FOR a GE appliance?\n Answer:","completion":" This is not an exact replacement. Do not try this. I did and had to make a lot of alterations to the unit which included removing the brackets from the original unit. It is not worth the savings even though it works. Even the mounting screws on the back do not match. I am a retired machinist and have always done all my home maintenance and you are better off buying the exact replacement unit from a GE distributor. I have since bought another complete range which includes the oven. The wife is now happy that her pies and turkeys come out the way she is used to.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the correct part for the burned-out broiler element on my GE range model JBP80C0F1CC?\n Answer:","completion":" I went to the GE website and located their suggested replacement part. Using the same criteria, I found the same part even with matching part numbers on Amazon, and saved about $65.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I WANT A BROIL UNIT FOR A HOTPOINT MODEL RB787WH1WW\n Answer:","completion":" What I did to find the one for my GE oven, was to go to the factory website (Hotpoint, in your case) and locate the specific item needed. Then search on Amazon for the same part by the Hotpoint part number. Saved myself about $85 by doing that. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this fit JBP78 broiler element? looks exactly the same. Mine caught fire,like welding machine, saw there is a lot of complaints about these oven.\n Answer:","completion":" The bracket has to be modified and the old mounting hardware adapted. If I had to do it again I would search for an exact replacement. My wife was afraid of it once she looked in the oven and saw the way it was mounted (weeks later and after she had used it). I ended up buying her a new oven to keep her happy!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what broil element for GEmodel JBP24BY1WH electric range\n Answer:","completion":" I have no idea. I bought my element for a Kenmore range.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this broil element replacement work in a GE model #J BP22B K1WH electric range?\n Answer:","completion":" No, you want WB44K10002 to replace the broil element for that model range.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit have a fan in it? Does this unit stay cool enougth on the bottom\/sides to use on a dinner table? I want to use it for Shabu Shabu.\n Answer:","completion":" No fan. I set it on a formica table with no damage and didn't feel any heat on the table itselt. I put up 20 jars of jam using it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is it made?\n Answer:","completion":" Made in the good ole USA !\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am interested in a hot plate to use for canning both pressure and waterbath. Can this hot plate be used for that purpose?\n Answer:","completion":" This has turned out to be an excellent hot plate for both canning and pressure cooking. We now do our pressure cooking (canned salmon) on this hot plate sitting in our barbeque outdoors on the deck to avoid any odors in our home. It works well and I'm sure you'll have no problems with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is the cord? thank you\n Answer:","completion":" This product has a standard 3-prong grounded cord with a length of approximately 3 feet or 0.914 meters.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Looking for one that will hold 175 degree to 195 degree. will it do this when there are only low med high settings.will it hold up to 40 lb in skillet\n Answer:","completion":" It has infinite settings and although I haven't tried it, I think it will. Unit is very heavy duty, the same as an electric range. 40 lbs. is a helluva heavy cookware. I think it will do it, how many times, I don't know.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the coil be removed or lifted up to clean the drip tray?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. The element lifts up and the drip pan can be removed and cleaned. The unit is mostly commercial grade stainless steel and very easy to keep clean.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it hold a temp. Say 180 F? Or will there be a fuxuation going up and down to maintain a temp?\n Answer:","completion":" The temperature is accurate as any stove top with the same tungsten elements. They will fluctuate, it's the nature of the material. But my experience is that it will fluctuate between my Temperature and +2 degrees. The unit is very well built, light-weight, sturdy and strong. It has a 3 foot power cord with a ground prong. The case is made of Stainless Steel and it stands off the counter top approximately 5\/8 of an inch. It has an Indicator light to show the heat cycle is turned on and the light will go off when the cycle is done. With a fast cycle, it maintains the heat setting very well. However, if your looking to add this to your Science Laboratory to maintain constant temperature at precisely 180 degrees ... or your experiment will fail.. then look elsewhere. Otherwise this is a fine product for anything else you want to cook. I'd bet it is more accurate than the Oven in your home.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i use cast iron cvookware\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if you can, but the hot plate can handle the weight.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 1500 watts.. this is the maximun single hot plate available ? or broil king got a most powerfull one ?\n Answer:","completion":" The way I understand it, it is the maximum. Anything bigger has to be plugged in to 220 not 110.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it cook eggs, boil water, cook other easy foods\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! We used this as our one and only burner during a home remodel. We were replacing a not-so-great stove and I found this burner to be better and more even than the burners I was used to. We were able to manage cooking for our family of five with this burner, a good toaster oven and the microwave.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it fit FGHG2366PF which calls for ULTRAWF?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it will not. ULTRAWF can be used in place of the WF3CB as an upgraded filter, but the WF3CB cannot be used in place of the ULTRAWF.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How to replace filter?\n Answer:","completion":" My model has the filter in the upper right corner in the fridge. I was able to push in and the filter releases and comes out. Then place the new one in and do the same. Push in and it will stay in place. That is it. Most simple filter change I have ever done. Hope this helps as some models are different than others. Good Luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought this filter on july18 and already it shows to be replaced, i don't understand that since according Frigidaire replace filter every 6 months.\n Answer:","completion":" It depends on how much you use the water from your fridge, the filter is good for X amount of gallons.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is 1 filter the \"frigidaire' price of $34.75, yet the three pack is almost five times that price? for that price you could almost get 2 free!\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you for your question. The retail price is based primarily on what we can get the product at wholesale. There are times when the individual prices are going to be less than the package deals. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Jason Troncone Alpha Omega Group\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The Frigidaire website is sell Ultra, is it the same as PureSource 3?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. They have a pure source 2 also but this is the 3.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a micron rating?\n Answer:","completion":" Ahhh. not that I noticed. It's not reverse osmosis, if that's what you're hoping for. Taste and odor is the main points on this. Doesn't filter nitrates. If you're on city water, they should filter out state standards in their systems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can a Pure Source Ultra filter be used in a fridge that came with a Pure Source 3 filter?\n Answer:","completion":" No. I made the mistake of getting one at Home Depot, too big. Ended up having to order the Pure Source 3 online.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this price per filter or $32.48 for 3 filters?\n Answer:","completion":" It is for a single filter. Hope this helps you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought this version but it didn't fit. I need a Pure Source Ultra. Check what version \"Pure Source\" you need.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I had to get out my manual to be certain I bought the right one. Easy to 'click' the wrong one. Wise advice!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be installed directly in the water line without any additional shutoffs or pressure valves? I have a limited amount of space to install this.\n Answer:","completion":" I would NOT recommend installing without the shut and bypass valves. It's not a question of IF you need to replace the filter, but when you need to replace, you got to shut the water off near the filter to do it. Or else you'll have water spewing out everywhere. Even if you shut the main line off outside once you remove the filter, all the water left in the line will come gushing out...don't do it. Put the valves in. Pressure gauges are not necessary, but the shut-off valves are.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it filter out flouride?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Just solids and chlorine as far as the package says. I think you need RO for that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the filter include a cartridge?\n Answer:","completion":" The filter is integrated into the cartridge. It is not separate. There are replacements available on Amazon and usually last 1 year of use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How often does the filter need to be changed on an AP903 when it is used only 4 months a year\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think there is a good, simple answer to this question. The life of the carbon block media is dependent mostly on your specific water quality. In other words, the worse your input water is, the less it will last. Still, even this is an oversimplification as different types of contaminate will effect the carbon media differently. This is all to say that this particular filter may only last 4 months if your property is using a non-municipal water source (i.e. well water). Perhaps if your use is so irregular, maybe looking into one of the more simple, standard, 10 or 20\" filter housings would be best. Big box hardware stores will usually have 10\" carbon block or GAC filters in stock and you could simply change the filter at any time. In any case I would recommend changing out the filter prior to first use after its sat for 8 months unused. Carbon block filters, even ones with anti-bacteria additives, can build up dangerous amounts of bacteria given enough time (and I think 8 months is more than enough). Carbon filters that have sat in stale water for that long should be changed out (and filter housings cleaned with bleach if applicable) prior to consuming any water from that system.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter out radon?\n Answer:","completion":" No. radon gas must have a a high efficiency filter- formerly known as \"HEPA\". How ever if you have particulates that give off radon, it captures those. Capture is dependent on the filter pore size- info I do not have at hand right now. Thus if you are fitering water from a well it would reduce the radon due to reduced particles. Not because it can capture gases. Most filters that use charcoal can capture radon gas, but they have a very limited life span. ( of course the more water you filter the shorter the life span.)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a strong sulphur odor in my cold water(on a well). Will your filter remove this?\n Answer:","completion":" It does appear to remove sulphur, but our levels may not be the same as yours. This is a very easy and simple filter to install and change. I would not recommend as a replacement for a salt-based system, but rather as a secondary filter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how is the apif 300 iron remover filter system?\n Answer:","completion":" The AP903 works well for a boat supplied by pier water. Clean taste and adequate flow.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Several people provided bad reviews for the filters not working after a few days. Why did they not last?\n Answer:","completion":" Wanted a little extra installed a AP903 and AP801C in series with the latter first in February and couldn't be happier. This is on a well and haven't touched since installation---\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How is this system for ferrous iron and metallic ordors?\n Answer:","completion":" The system works very Well. Except if you live in a place like on Long Island with high iron and metallic odor, it will work great but start to get stuffed up after 6 months, and you start losing pressure in your house after about 3 months. Its much cheaper than a salt based system of thousands of dollars. But know that this system will need frequent filter changes. It won't last a year, only maybe 6 months.

{"prompt":"Question: How much hot water does it use? (ie. is a 6 gallon hot water tank sufficient?)\n Answer:","completion":" maybe if your recovery time is less than 15 minutes which I doubt and dont mind a life cycle of 3 1\/2 years and a machine that cant handle large loads....there allot better machine out there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm concerned about noise level and I read lots of reviews that say this is noisy, but how noisy?\n Answer:","completion":" very and mine completely died out of warranty after 3-4 years...got a Sears Hotpoint now like it allot better\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: stops at rinse and spin cycle, why?\n Answer:","completion":" The computer in the machine continually shorted. If you buy this machine you will regret it later- guaranteed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I believe loose coins have gotten down under the agitator. Is it possible to get to them myself or will I have to call a repair every time it happens?\n Answer:","completion":" Our experience has been that if there are loose coins or pins, etc. they have found their way out from under the agitator and stayed at the bottom of the tub where we could pick them out. I don't know if any still are under there. I would not concern myself nor call for service if the machine was operating properly.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the Whirlpool top loader washer WTW4800BQ0 a good machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Susan. After reading the other responses, I have to say that I do NOT agree with them. I have had this machine since May 2013. I have NEVER had any issues with it. I do 5 to 8 loads of laundry every weekend. Never had a breakdown, never had clothes 'get holes in them', never had clothes 'disappear'. I use the Regular Light, Casual Light, and Delicate cycles mostly. Handles a large loads like towels (8 large) just fine on the 'super' water setting on the Normal Light cycle. Same goes for large loads of jeans (8 pairs) Takes just under an hour for the light cycles to finish, and less with the Delicate. The loads get cleaned well. The lid does lock, but only after the washer has finished filling and the cycle begins. Lid locks are now standard on ALL new washing machines per Federal safety law. I follow the manufacturers instructions and use the washer as it was intended using common sense that dictates to NEVER overload a clothes washer as to not cause undo stress on the machine or your laundry. Another thing to know is that this washer has a standard agitator in the middle of the basket. There is a similar model to this one that is a High Efficiency machine that does not have an agitator and that machine gets a lot of bad reviews as well. I have found that some comments for this machine are really pertaining to that other machine. To be fair, I have owned the washer for under a year, and there have been some comments that this machine starts having problems after a year's time. So I'll just have to see about that and cross that bridge IF I get to it. On a side note, I have the matching 7.0 Gas Dryer and it is a VERY GOOD dryer. Simple to use and dries our laundry effectively. I hope this answer helps you. Thank you\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does your washer sound like it is in a bind when it is washing?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does. The sounds it makes is weird...very unlike my previous washer. It's so upsetting that the new, \"improved\" version of washers actually suck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: does it have a matching dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm having problems with my washer eating my clothes! It's really pissing me off. It doesn't matter the size of the load either. ANNOYED! How about u?\n Answer:","completion":" Face it, it is a piece of junk. Mine died after less than 2 years and my repairman said it wasn't worth fixing. I went to a used appliance store and bought an old model that doesn't lock the lid, you can let clothes soak, and it isn't constantly refusing to spin---and the repairman will be able to fix it at a reasonable price. I love it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this washer have a agitator\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, but it's way smaller than the older models. Now these so-called \"modern\" models have such small agitators that it does not clean your clothes very well -- not at all like the models of past. Terrible!!!!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is anyone else not having \"warm\" water? When I use the warm water setting only cold water comes out. I have watched it fill til the end, too.\n Answer:","completion":" Even though I have serious questions about one or two of what seems to me idiotic design flaws on this machine I would say the engineer is dumb but not stupid. They wouldn't be that stupid. Yes the warm water works fine. Even though the manual is too skimpy on explaining things, it appears to have a temperature sensor that adjusts the amounts of cold and hot that enters. Works great on mine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to fill washer with just hot water no clothes?\n Answer:","completion":" These high efficiency washers will not fill. They work by spraying water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you load the washer with just hot water and then add clothes and detergent ?\n Answer:","completion":" The machine won't do this. It only adds water based on the weight of the clothes already loaded (and doesn't add enough). The way I have gotten around this has been to detach the hot water hose from the machine and turn on the faucet and add it myself.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you reset washing machine after replacing the lid lock switch\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry Terri I have never had to do that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: iS IT NORMAL TO MAKE LOUD NOISE AT BEGINNING?\n Answer:","completion":" Do you mean \"at beginning\" of a cycle or when it is newly installed? It does make a suffcient amount of noise during every cycle; however, it should not \"walk.\" And the noise will continue as time goes on but at least it is working! I am still pleased with this washing machine.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Just want to confirm this unit comes with all the tubing needed so all I need to do is get co2 gas and it is ready to go.\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with everything. The tank that comes with it is awfully small and difficult to get filled. You can easily get a larger tank from your local gas dealer, and they usually have an exchange program too. It even comes with replacement gaskets (all of them). It takes a little time to get the pressure adjusted right, but after that, let the good times flow!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many amps of an electronic breaker does this unit require? 15, 20, or 25, or others? thanks\n Answer:","completion":" My Installers threw away all the manuals! I was not too happy. But I believe it draws very little Amps...like around 4ish...so I think you would be more than fine with 15. I looked it up at Lowes and they say 3.3 amps for a 450 CFM, so right around there I would assume. On another note, we are very happy with this. It is much quieter than the one we replaced and we always get compliments on it. It lights up very well and it sucks the steam and grease right up. Hope this helps.\n"}

IDK what size the mesh is. It catches all but the very finest of particles. Mine is a 2\" slip fit. Ours clogs quite often but we have a lot of silt in the well water because of the drought. We use ours on our house on a 1\" line and it works xlnt. Put a valve on each side of it, because you'll want to shut off the outlet line to flush it. (If the water is being drawn through the filter the particles stick to the filter and don't flush out well) And the inlet line to occationally remove and hand wash the filter. I would also recomend a cover for the thing to keep sun from getting on it, ours started to grow alge. But it's a very good filter, will be buying another for the guest house soon as I get to it.

{"prompt":"Question: Is this the Dark chocolate color? I'm looking for a lighter color with hold flecks throughout.\n Answer:","completion":" Let me first say that I worked for 30 yrs at PPG paint in various departments matching colors. I have this RO tap within 10 in of a Moen oil rubbed bronze faucet. The Moen does have small aluminum flakes in the coating giving it the appearance of gold flakes. The two blend so well I thought the RO tap had gold flakes also. However it doesn't. It appears to have very small particle size mica in the coating. On cars, the mica would give the coating a subtle sparkle versus aluminum which can be small particle size giving the subtle reflectiveness or the in your face large particle aluminum that sparkles not just that little shimmer. Taking into account the sparkle\/shimmer effect of mica and aluminum flake it would easily be an industry match since untrained eyes cannot pick up the minute color differences. So I would say it doesn't have a solid chocolate brown appearance and it is not an exact match to my Moen faucet. But unless you get up close with a light to reflect off of the coating, you'd consider it a good match. Aside from that, you cna always return it if the subtle differences bother you.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I think I get the intended use of this, but I just want to make sure... Can this be used as a pre filter between my well and well pump?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it could, but I don't think it is recommended to put a filter on the suction side if your pump.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My well water contains silt that clogs my washing machine. Which filter should I use on the washing machine cold water inlet line?\n Answer:","completion":" This requires a multifaceted answer. First of all, how large is the sediment your well draws in? These filters are available in several different screen or mesh filter sizes. If it is sandy, you need to compare the size of the sand to the micron size of the filter element. I'd say this is the most important research that you need to do. Next I'd ask how much sand gets drawn in say daily, then over the course of a week. Thus could be determined by how much sand is in your toilet tanks, (when you take the lid off and look inside); then how often do you clean the screens on the washer? Lastly, do you see sand in the faucet arreaters? If the answer is a great deal to any of the above questions, I would advise you to get a filter which is one pipe size larger then then waterline coming from your pressure pump\/ inlet to your house. This will allow a longer time between flushing intervals of the filter. I have used them in this application in the past, with great results for our customers. If it is installed correctly, the drain on the bottom would be run to the outside,or a nearby drain. Be sure to install a union on the drain line to allow for occasional disassembly. When the filter shows signs of being clogged- sediment in the bottom, color in the screen; then you flush it out for 1-2 minutes, until clear. I hope this helps you. I am a plumber in northern Arizona, and would recommend this item.\n"}

While the long end is meant to insert into the drain opening, the other end(w\/hose clamp) is meant to attach to a ridged pipe.

{"prompt":"Question: I am building a new home and looking for a way to deal with hard water without the use of salt or potassium. How does your system work?\n Answer:","completion":" If you do not want to use salt or any other chemicals, this is the only other method you can use that has tested and proven results. The media acts as a catalyst to give something for the calcium and magnesium molecules to start their binding process on. Once they start binding the filter media, the break off as molecules bound together in your water so they do not look for other surfaces to cling to. Thus, you prevent scale build up on your appliances, etc. These work great for preventing damaging scale build up. The standard system works good in lower hardness ranges up to 25 gpg. If you have higher hardness levels, we can customize the system for your application. Just contact us, afw filters 785-735-9769\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have a Kenmore Elite side by side made by Whirlpool. The part number for the Kenmore is: W10335147A - Does anyone know if this is the same filter?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a Kenmore Elite as well, it is a 35 sq ft. side by side Refrigerator Freezer. I found on Amazon that the W10311524 has precisely the same demensions as the W103335147A. I therefore purchased three of the W10311524 on ebay postpaid for around $19.00. When they arrived I opened one and found it to be precisely the same right down to the number of pleats in the filter. It fit perfectly and even came with an identical triangular filter status indicator like the W10335147A that SEARS sells postpaid for $12.50 each. It appears that Whirpool now builds refrigerators for Frigidare, Kenmore and Kitchenade as well, and probably has different part numbers on this filter for each brand! I am now looking for a sheet of the filter material containing the activated carbon. If I can find it it should be an easy matter to cut the filter material with a paper cutter and then fan fold it. The white plastic case can be easily taken apart and washed, the new fanfolded filter inserted, and then the rebuilt filter easily installed for a cost of $0.25 a change or less. Off course one would not have a valid indicator gauge, but adding a reminder to change filters every six months on one's smart phone could easily fix that! Finally, I would not run any of these refrigeratoirs with a filter very long. The filter has two purposes the first to keep dust and debrie from accumulating on the internal condensing coils and secondly to eliminate refigerator oders using the activated charcoal. These new refrigerators have a closed system so that one no longer have to brush and vacuum these coils. This especially nice for us as our siamese cat's favorite spot is just to the left of our refrigerator.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the filter come with the filter status indicator\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it's included\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do I measure for drip pan size?\n Answer:","completion":" You must know your stove manufacturer and see if what you're looking at is recommended. If your stove is a Whirlpool, log on to their website and ask. I think that's your best bet; otherwise, you'll be buying something that doesn't fit. My stove is a Whirlpool and the drip pans fit perfectly. (by the way, I have a black stove and ordered black drip pans).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long do the Grey\/ Biscuit pans last?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sorry to say that I don't have the answer to that. I ordered these twice and each time they were damaged, the porcelain was chipped somewhere on one of the 4 drip pans. Since they are made of porcelain, they can get chipped. I was very happy with the color, fit, and quality otherwise. But I couldn't get 4 pans to arrive in perfect condition from Whirlpool. I would have tried until they got it right, but Amazon stopped sending me a replacement set after two tries, since they assumed it would continue to be a problem and wanted to investigate with the manufacturer of the product. I would like to try again because the price was right and I would assume they'd last for quite awhile, like years, if you are careful about not dropping cooking pans onto your burners.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used these on a Frigidaire stove? Our stove came with drip pans that look like this but they are in terrible shape now.\n Answer:","completion":" I bought these drip pans for a GE unit!

These must be put on before the dryer was stacked. Not sure I'd anyone else felt th is way but those long plastic pieces fit funny on the dryer and did not snap into place very easy. I actually thought for a minute I bought the wrong stacking kit. In addition there is an anchoring kit that screws into the back of each unit. This can be done once the pair is stacked.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Hi I need this part for a GE fridge in Venezuela (model GST201BMBW). Is this part the right one?\n Answer:","completion":" I cannot be exactly sure without examining your fridge, but it was the part that corrected our problem. When we turned our fridge on the temperature would come down, but never get as cold as it should. The problem was intermittent and hard to diagnose. We used an appliance website to help us \"trouble shoot\" the issue, tried various parts and eventually this worked. We ordered from Amazon because the price was cheaper. If you order this, just make sure whether you need the little white corded thermistor (as pictured) for your model or not. They make one that comes without it also. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it comes in original GE Box?\n Answer:","completion":" The fan comes in a box from Sealed Unit Parts Company, Inc (Supco). I will say that everything was exactly the same as the unit that it replaced so I don't know if this company supplies this part to GE or not. I will also say that for the model of my refrigerator, GE typically identified the replacement part as the fan and connector only without the thermostat or the blue grommet. I did not want to get into the more extensive work related to cutting of the grommet so it could be reused and moving the thermostat connections to the new fan so I continued my research and came across this on Amazon. A little more research and I was able to identify this was the exact replacement I needed. Ordering this part from Amazon was actually cheaper than what the local appliance parts house wanted to charge for the fan by itself so I'm very pleased with the purchase.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have a GE Profile side by side refrigerator model PSS26MSRSS. The water dispenser just trickles water. It also makes a little noise while it dispenses water. I tried defrosting water line. That is not the answer. The Ice maker &amp; dispensor works fine....\n Answer:","completion":" Several possible causes of problems with water to dispenser. Troubleshooting tips: 1. Check to see if the ice maker is still working. If so, the problem is probably not caused by a water filter problem since the water to the ice maker has to go through the filter also. 2. Disconnect water tubing connector at bottom of refrigerator where it enters the freezer door. Then press water dispenser switch. If water comes out of the disconnected line then the problem is probably a frozen water line in the freezer door. Reconnect the line and defrost the freezer. If the problem occurs again there are other measures that can be taken to prevent freezing. 3. Turn off power, remove cover and valve bracket on the back of the unit, and pull the valve assembly out where you can get to it. There are two valves. The first valve is the inlet valve and must open whenever the ice maker or the water dispenser operates. The second valve has two separate outlets - one for the ice maker and one for the freezer. There is a short tubing from the outlet of the first valve to the inlet of the second valve. Disconnect this tubing by pressing in on the connector while pulling out on the tube. Direct the open end of the tube toward a pan. Then keeping clear of all electrical wires, plug the refrigerator back in. Press the water dispenser. If water does not come out of the inlet valve, the valve is probably bad. If it does come out, it is probably the second valve. You can run a similar test on the second valve if the first valve proves to be okay. 4. If you are comfortable with your do-it-yourself skills, you can also use a voltmeter to confirm that the valve is receiving 110 volts when the water dispenser is depressed. I even went so far as to jumper the water dispenser connector to the ice maker side of the valve to confirm that that side would open when I depressed the water dispenser. Be careful if you try these because you are working with 110 volt power. If the valve is not getting 110v power when the dispenser is depressed, it is probably due to either a bad controller board or a bad electrical connection.\n"}

The valve was located at the bottom left of the back of the refrigerator. I shut off the water supply at the wall, unplugged the refrigerator and then unscrewed and took off the lower rear cover panel and disconnected the main water line running into the solenoid valve. I disconnected the valve and then pulled off the two lines running to the ice maker and water dispenser, and simply reconnected all three lines (the main water line from the wall) and the two lines up to the ice maker and dispenser, and then I re-hooked the valve into the fridge, plugged in the fridge, turned on the water, and then checked the dispenser. No more dripping water. I hope this helps you.\n"}

I installed the base unit and one remote (outside) on 2012 Dec 2. I'd ordered lithium batteries for it (good for temperature extremes), but they hadn't arrived yet, so I loaded them up with some AA Duracell alkaline batteries I had. 472 days later, the main unit started losing contact with the remote, and I noticed its low battery indicator was on. The remote was still going strong. I replaced the alkaline batteries in both units with the lithium batteries that I'd ordered back in 2012. That works out to 15 months (over two winters and one summer) on just regular alkaline batteries. I'm expecting longer life from the lithiums.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is there a way to tap both keg at once for use\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used to force carbonate beer?\n Answer:","completion":" It would force carbonate a keg, but you would need to use the paintball tank option and it would probably take a couple weeks. If you used the 16 gram co2 cartridges, it would take several of them to carbonate one keg. I have always used priming sugar and let the kegs carbonate naturally and then used the party pub to dispense and maintain carbonation.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do I need to buy a CO2 tank or does the product come with one? How often does it need to be filled?\n Answer:","completion":" You have to buy these as a separate purchase. They don't last long, maybe a keg or so. You should buy several at a time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What beers can fit this dispenser? All 5 liter kegs?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, 5 L kegs, not to be confused with 5 gallon kegs. I've found that they are harder to find, but available if you have a good liquor store. Breckenridge Brewery always releases their season beer in this size, and my store usually imports a couple from Germany. But you can use it with the Heineken and New Castle one that are available every where. If you buy empty kegs some craft brewers will fill them for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the average temp range? Meaning, does it keep the beer really cold?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine is currently sitting at 40 Fahrenheit\/5 Celsius, and it maintains that easily. It can go lower, but I leave it on that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this a thermoelectric cooler or does it use a freon compressor unit like a standard refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" This is not a thermoelectric cooler. It has a compressor just like a refrigerator. It's not the quietest unit, but the entire inside compartment is cooled including the hoses. This unit is way better than the thermoelectric models. I highly recommend this unit!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you screw off the black tap handle and put on a different one?\n Answer:","completion":" It turns slightly but I don't think it will come off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Keurig B79 Single (K) cup. Will these filters fit my machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi! If your B79 came with a removable water filter device in the water tank (it should have) these charcoal filters will fit just fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you replace the filter?\n Answer:","completion":" Follow directions in your book. Every Keurig is not the same. On my Keurig - the water filter is in the water reservoir. There is a removable plastic piece and you take the old filter out and put a new one in. you have to soak it for 20 min. in water first then run under the spigot for 60 seconds. Hope this was a help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do they work with the k-45 Keurig brewer?\n Answer:","completion":" yes as long as you have the insert to go into the water area, I use them all the time, it helps with not having to clean your machine as much. You can rotate the date so you know when to insert another filter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long does one filter last before it has to be replaced?\n Answer:","completion":" The filter should be replaced every 1-2 months, depending upon usage. I set my dial for 2 months ahead as we brew only about 3-4 cups per day.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it fit my Keurig coffe maker?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It fits fine. I am sure that the charcoal filters will fit in any Keurig coffee maker. Slipped right in to the spot the original one was.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: These are knockoffs don't buy?\n Answer:","completion":" Yeah, they're knockoffs. So what? They work fine, and they're a lot cheaper than the brand name ones. If they're the same filter, why would you want to spend the money on the brand panel? Been using these for about two years. They're great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the filters genuine Keurig water filters?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine came in very authentic-looking Keurig package. The Keurig website sells a 6-pack of water filters but doesn't show an image of the package (just 6 unboxed filters lined up).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these work in the Kuerig single cup maker?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the adjustable height of this Range. The Cut Sheet I have says that the 36\" height is adjustable, but the documents don't say how much.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't remember the height.. you should be aware that we had our stove replace three times because of part failures....we finally got our money back from frigidare and bought a Kitchen Aid Dual Fuel Stove....we had three frigidar item that were supposed to be the top of the line along with the stove......37 repair visit in 4 months before the gave us our money back....RUN FORREST RUN!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I want the delivery people move away my old stove and connect the new stove for me. Any charge? If so, how much?\n Answer:","completion":" Since these are delivered by a network of freight carriers, who aren't trained in installation, and who don't have certified disposal facilities, these services aren't offered at this time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is this $4.99 for shipping and does this come in black?\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you for your interest in Goedekers! This item is only available in stainless steel.

{"prompt":"Question: are there internal threads (female) at ends of filter??\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, they are inside the ends, not the outside. The adaptors screw into the ends.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my fridge uses filter 9030, will this filter fit mine? If so do I use the little ends from the old filter to connect this one?\n Answer:","completion":" We received this filter and it simply snapped onto to the connections from the old filter with no problem.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are these filters \"charcoal\" filters? Don't want to assume anything.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Genuine KitchenAid parts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use Cuisinart replacement pods?? (They look exactly the same but are cheaper)\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't know about the Cuisinart pods....but I will certainly research them. In my opinion, they will have to be an exact fit in order for the long end of the pod holder to snap tightly and securely. I am really hoping that these work because of the price difference.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: anyone know which of these darned filter pods is the smaller one????\n Answer:","completion":" It is always difficult to tell based on the filter alone; it is much easier if you buy them based on the model \/ serial on the bottom of the kitchen aid coffee maker. The related model \/ serial numbers should be included in the product information for whatever filters you are looking at.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i have a 1202 coffee maker. will these fit? the 11WF is too big\n Answer:","completion":" I purchase the KCM22WF and have used these for four or five years now. They have always worked in the Kitchen Aid coffee makers that I have had. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will the Kcm22WF water filter fit the KCM1402 coffee maker\n Answer:","completion":" I think they may fit your coffee maker. I bought them by mistake because they look the same as the 11's I need but are larger. I looked at the Kitchenaid site and your coffee maker takes the filters with \"22\" in the filter number.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will kcm22wf fit a kcm1402 coffee maker ?\n Answer:","completion":" The product description gives the following models: KCM222CU KCM222OB KCM223CU KCM223OB however, the 1402 model looks exactly like these models so I am not sure why they would not work. If the shape is the same I would say (unofficially) that they should.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these filters work with the KitchenAid Model #KCM223CU0?\n Answer:","completion":" They will fit. I also bought the cleancaf to descale. Machine still works great with cleaning indicator light it's a breeze. You won't believe what comes out in a cleaning. Good luck.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: This item looks like it is stiff, and if it's too long, you'll have to either cut it or route it in a strange path. Is this right?\n Answer:","completion":" It's not too stiff and should be cut to length with tin snips. Best to not have an more bends in the pipe than necessary due to lint build-up in the bends.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it possible to have it cut down to four Feet?...thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure. You could ask your local building dept.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is it to cut ?\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't have to cut it ... So not sure. I've cut other similar hoses in the past w no problems\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I cook Thai-foods on gas stove, will this hood be the right one for me?\n Answer:","completion":" This hood has worked pretty well when I used it in the context of Indian food. Indian food is comparable to Thai in terms of spice levels. You need to ensure you have it connected to an external vent though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My Broan only has a rectangle vent at back of rang hood, does this one fit my wall vent? Or do I need extra dry wall work to fit the round hose pipe\n Answer:","completion":" The AKDY has a round vent at the top of the unit, so you'll have to cover the existing hole and make a new opening. I've found that a 6\" hole saw made for recessed lighting works wonders for that application.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work without an external duct (i.e. ductless)?\n Answer:","completion":" No. It requires an exhaust outlet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the CFM at low and medium fan speed?\n Answer:","completion":" most of the time i use it at midium speed and no smell, but i cannot tell you the cfm\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If any one switched out the lights, how did you? and mine only shows military time does all do this?\n Answer:","completion":" having trouble with time. yes. Just military time.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit plug into regular 3 prong outlet or does it need to be hard wired?\n Answer:","completion":" I just plugged it into the regular outlet where the replaced microwave used to be. The unit looks good and works ok.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the vent opening compatible with 6\" or 8\"? The product description says Inner Dia is 8\" but many comments here say 6\". Thanks for your help.\n Answer:","completion":" The response for confusion is the seller switched models using the same item number. You have verified purchasers of the previous model answering questions about the new model\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the underside area behind the lights difficult to keep clean?\n Answer:","completion":" no it's very simple to clean. I like the hood in general,really not bad at all, it's just not as powerful as we hoped...good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does the delay shutdown function work?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, I am not sure because I returned the unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many inches in distance is the hood from your range? Thank you,\n Answer:","completion":" 29 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have just a clock, or does it also have a timer?\n Answer:","completion":" Its a clock\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have an 8' ceiling, can this be mounted on the wall with only using one seamless piece? It will be vented out.\n Answer:","completion":" Depending on the height of your mount. But most likely it will take 2 sleeves. One overlapping the other a bit. They do have rather tight seems that it's not overly noticable. Hope that helps\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone have a manufacturers phone number for service\/warranty? Nothing in documentation. Just installed and it appears electronics board is bad\n Answer:","completion":" Hello. Number is 626-453-0550. They are only open M-F 9 - 5:30 Pacific time. It does seem to me that when I received my package, there was a number on the box that may have been different that also reached them. They were very helpful. However, the clock does run extremely fast and is never right, FYI\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you confirm maximum width, as it must fit in 30\" space. thanks\n Answer:","completion":" yes. You will have about 1\/4\" so measure carefully! The vent stack was particularly hard to install. Might consider getting a couple of stainless self tapping screws. It is easy to put together on the ground but the vents would stay together at the joint. (There is a groove that the top one fits into the lower vent stack but it get popping out of mine!) Looks nice, works, fine and I got a great deal on it! Directions are horrible - translated from Chinese to English by a non-English speaker for sure!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Kitchen Aid KCM1402 coffee maker will these pods fit\n Answer:","completion":" No they do not - I wasnot happy...cant find one that does fit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these work with the KitchenAid KCM1402 coffee maker?\n Answer:","completion":" They fit, however the \"clean filter\" alert on the LED display does not go away when I use them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this water filter fit Kichenaid KCM223 coffee maker?\n Answer:","completion":" Barbara - According to the box, it fits KCM222 and KCM223. I do not have a KCM223, though, so I cannot guarantee it will fit (I have KCM222).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what filter pod fits kcm1202\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know. i am just a consumer. You need to look it up online and am sure you could find the right one. I think all you need is the model #. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there another filter that fits a KCM1202 coffee maker?\n Answer:","completion":" I scoured the internet and am not sure what water filter model it is. I do know that the kcm2wf fits the kcm1203. I would imagine it would work for the kcm1202 since the models are so close. That's the best answer I could come up with.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a kitchen aid KCM1202OB, this filter will work? if not which one will work?\n Answer:","completion":" It didn't work in my coffee pot - don't know why - so I cannot answer your question. Sorry\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How often do you replace these things?\n Answer:","completion":" I have city water so I replace mine every 60 days as recommended. If you have whole house water filtering, then every 90 to 120 days. It does make a difference .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it fit the kitchen aid coffee pot model kcm140?\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not fit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this filter work for a samsung model RF267AERS?\n Answer:","completion":" It should -it is for Samsung- but that is not the model frig I have - It is well worth the money - 1\/2 the price of Lowes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this model compatible with samsung RS21HDUSW1 ?\n Answer:","completion":" i matched the model # on the amazon description with the owners manual. the model # inside the door did not match.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We put in a filterAce+ filter on our Samsung French door RF266AEWP model. Now we cannot remove it. We bought it in Jan.2012. Now what? Samsung will not cover damage incurred by using generic filters.\n Answer:","completion":" I have found it difficult to remove the filter (even the Samsung filters). My filter is in the back right corner of the refrigerator, with a wine shelf in the way. I use a 'rubber husband' gripper to firmly hold the filter to turn it. Also, make sure you are turning it counter clockwise. As there is pressure in the water line, that also causes some resistance. I have never needed to do so, but you could shut off the water line to the refrigerator, drain some water from the water dispenser and see if that helps. Otherwise call Hulk Hogan to try to turn it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter work in a Samsung model rf268abwp refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" I Googled the model # of the refrigerator you provided to find the # of the water filter you would need. It appears this filter would work. However, to be sure, you may want to remove the filter presently in your refrigerator and match its' model number with what Filter Ace+ advertises it can replace. If you don't want to remove the filter, you can either refer to the manual that came with the refrigerator or give Samsung a call directly. They can provide you with the model number of the filter you need. Then just match that number to the replacement filter. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I too had a problem with a non-EOM filter not locking. Will this one work with my RFG297AARS?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can the ovens be used without convection? in other words, can the convectioin feature be left off?\n Answer:","completion":" Well the top smaller oven is not convection at all. You can use the bottom oven with or without convection also\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hey Owners, what does \"Power Outage Compatible\" mean? Range top works without A\/C? I hope..I have no idea is not an answer. :-)\n Answer:","completion":" Cooktop does not work without ac power. Igniters and fuel lockoff require it to operate\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this range require a 220v outlet? (Like the kind a clothes dryer requires?)\n Answer:","completion":" my electrician had to install a special outlet for the stove so I think yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do either of the ovens have a broiler?\n Answer:","completion":" both ovens have broil function only bottom oven has convection though\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what do I need to install the KitchenAid Architect Series II KDRS505XSS 30 Freestanding Dual-Fuel Double Oven Range, when it arrives???\n Answer:","completion":" You will ne 30 inch wide counter space, You will also require a dual fuel line. I would check with your contractor prior to purchasing\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the oven come with a propane conversion kit?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it has a regulator on the back for propane or ng but I would call kitchen aid to make sure nothing else isnt needed\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are both ovens electric? why is there a 12000 BTU Broiler burner specified?\n Answer:","completion":" Both ovens are electric. You have a fifth burner in the center of the stove top for a grilling Pam that comes with this!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this range include the necessary 220 power chord? If not will you give me the name or number of the connector.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does have a 220 cord.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you cook a turkey in any of these ovens.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes the bottom oven works well for a turkey, the top oven would be too short.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If the power is down\/off at your home, can you still use the burners by lighting them with a match?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Joe--Naw, it doesn't appear that you can. It is possible to light the burners with a match if the electronic igniters were to fail, but the range must still be receiving power. When I trip the circuit breaker at the fuse box and try to light the burners by hand, I can't. There must be some kind of annoying \"safety\" feature that shuts off the gas to the burners if the unit loses electrical power--Chris\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i thought it also controled the fan opperations ?\n Answer:","completion":" This Device allows control of heat, cool, off or hold settings or switch temperature readings at the device or thermostat or of course set the temperature desired.

{"prompt":"Question: Hi, does this come with a Base thermostat and a portable one? Meaning, does it come with one that goes where the one I have now is,and a portable one?\n Answer:","completion":" No. This comes with a base station that u wire in where your old thermostat was and a thermostat that can be mounted on a wall in another room which saves you from running all new wires to a new desired location, but u can order a remote thermostat with it that sits on a dresser which is called the Honeywell REM5000R1001 portable comfort control. I purchased this too on amazon for around $90. Works great...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use more than one remote for two zones\n Answer:","completion":" no only one remote per system\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is minimal Redlink thermostat system I can use to control the temperature of the room I am in with the Portable Comfort Control?\n Answer:","completion":" In my house each floor\/zone has a wireless thermostate (3 total), an RF wireless receiver on zone control and this remote thermostat to control all zones. To control the floor I am on I can either walk to wireless thermostat screwed into the wall and adjust it or use the wireless portable to control any zone. I installed 2 years ago to eliminate walking up and down stairs to adjust zones.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How can I tell if the wiring for my existing thermostat is compatible with this system?\n Answer:","completion":" If you search for the wiring instructions for the Honeywell RedLINK system (example: Honeywell document 69-2091EFS), you can see the required wiring hookups. This should allow you to assess compatibility. If you are already using a modern (digital) thermostat, you should be able to install the RedLINK system without too much trouble. However, keep in mind that this system is intended to mount on or near the existing HVAC system, not at the location of the thermostat. So having access to your utility closet will be helpful.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I do not have a \"hold\" set on the remote, but I select \"read temp from this device\", will the main thermostat use the remote temp when following a schedule?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. 'read temp from this device' does exactly what it says, regardless of whether it's on hold or not.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have the Portable Comfort Control but I stepped on it. If I replace it with a new one, is it easy to set up?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - I was expecting to have trouble, but followed the instructions that come with the new one - which involves pointing the control at the wireless \"box\" that - in our case is mounted on the wall in our air handler cupboard.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is professional setup or installation required? I already have an installed Redlink thermostat.\n Answer:","completion":" I had a Lennox heatpump added to my gas furnace this spring. Reading through the new thermostat manual I found this item as an accessory and since I'm downstairs and renters are upstairs I thought it would be useful. I ordered through Amazon and the setup was a breeze. After installing the batteries it wants to search for a signal from the furnace\/heat pump. On the furnace there was a new control box of electronics, You remove the cover and there is a button you press, which sends out the signal to the remote......you can watch it happen on the screen.......poof it's links up and not a problem since. Simple instructions to follow came with the unit. Now I can observe and control from downstairs what the upstairs thermostat is doing........it's been great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this Portable Comfort Control come with the base unit? If not, then what do I need to have to controller communicate with to start the furnace?\n Answer:","completion":" This unit works in conjunction with a Comfortnet Thermostat. The thermostat only works with furnaces, heat pumps and condensers that are sold with Comfornet Communicating Interfaces integrated into the unit. The entire system must be manufactured with Comfortnet integrated by the manufacturer for it to all work. All the devices can communicate with all the other devices to maximize operation and provide diagnostic information to the user through the thermostats display.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This device doesn't work as a remote, wireless temp sensor, right? It just lets you change the thermostat setting remotely?\n Answer:","completion":" No sir.. It does work as a wireless temp sensor. I purchased because my thermostats are located in a weird place in the house. I wanted to be able to move the temp sensor around without moving the stat. For example, our bedroom stat is in the hallway. With this unit, I am able to read and adjust the bedroom temp. You can set it up to use the stat for the temp sensor or the remote temp sensor. Honestly, I love mine. I actually have 2 now and helped to eliminate moving the stat and fixed the hot\/cold spots where we generally are in the house. Easy to set up and works great. My stats are Honeywell VisionPro 8000.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this come with an LP conversion kit?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does. We did not need it because we have natural gas. We are VERY happy with this purchase.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with an LP conversion kit?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it comes with packet of different sizes to convert to LP.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: With the faucet do you just turn on the hot water? When it's done, do you immediately have to turn the faucet off? Where do Cascade packs go?\n Answer:","completion":" The dishwasher will heat the water on its own, so you can turn on hot, cold, or both. It also controls the water flow. Having the sink on doesn't make any water run. The dishwasher will turn the water off and on as the cycle runs. So you don't need to worry about turning it off right away. It will have the water stopped when it's done. Just make sure you turn the faucet off and hit the de-pressurize button before you unhook the hose from the sink. I've never used cascade packs, but now you have me wondering if that it what the tiny hanging basket is for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I notice that there is no information on the drain hose. Is it connected to the sink drain below the sink, or does it just lay in the sink to drain?\n Answer:","completion":" The drain hose is actually one piece together with the quick connect faucet adapter. It is a one piece that snaps onto your kitchen faucet. You turn on your hot water and when necessary, it will fill the tub. Once it is time to drain the tub, it will empty directly into your sink. (this way, you don't have to worry about a single loose hose that may fall out of the sink and onto your floor.) It also has a bypass button on the connector to let you obtain water from the faucet while connected. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the DEPTH\n Answer:","completion":" outside is 17x20x21.5 (HxDxW) inside is 12.5x17.5x20 (HxDxW) there's a lip on the outside where the hose runs along so it doesn't push away any further than the 20\", sometimes with bigger plates like larger dinner plates and some large cookware its a little harder to fit straight but with a little angling I haven't found anything that hasn't fit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: In case something goes wrong, has anyone returned this heavy unit to Amazon? Do you have to pay shipping?\n Answer:","completion":" I have never returned this particular item to Amazon, but I have returned other large, heavy, and bulky items. If the item is defective or arrives damaged, Amazon always has paid the shipping for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I would have to install this on a shelf thats lower than my sink, would the pump be able to pump the water up into the sink?\n Answer:","completion":" I have mine on a rolling cart that is much lower then my sink and I have no problems other then the hoses don't totally empty out and will spill water on floor when I unhook if I don't keep the up\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone experienced a leak? Teflon tape on the faucet adapter works great, but my countertop still has puddles of water after use. Any thoughts?\n Answer:","completion":" I had puddles once. I hand-tightened the hose connections on the back and haven't had an issue since. I've had the dishwasher for 1 1\/2 years and LOVE it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the exact measurement of the hose, from attachment to attachment? Thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" Using a tape measure and stretching the hose out, it came out to about 55\" or 4 ft 7\". I thought I read somewhere that the hoses were 5ft long, and some of the difference may be the bends in the hoses and the inability to stretch them out completely straight. If you figure putting your dishwasher within 4 to 4 1\/2 ft of your sink hookup, you will probably have no difficulty.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I don't have much space on the countertop (tiny kitchen), but can free space under the sink. Has anyone tried to put it that low? Will it drain?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not have one yet, but on other sites I have read that people have put it under their sinks and had it connected to the plumbing under there and it worked great. They all had plumbers do that for them. I'm planning to get a rolling cart to put mine on, so I can roll it up to the sink when using then put it in the closet when not.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Actual size: Does anyone know which is correct?\n Answer:","completion":" SPT is Suppentown. The company or Amazon should alert customers to that. Some SPT products sold through Amazon are listed as Suppentown SPT. Unit dimension (W x D x H) 21.65 x 19.69 x 17.24 in (copied from website) Package dimension 21.85 x 21.21 x 20.39 in I'm late to the game but hope this serves as an FYI for others.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many gallons of water is used during a cycle? I am off a well and it doesn't have a great amount of water in it (we run out every few weeks).\n Answer:","completion":" One section of my sink is about 13\"x15\". With a drain plug, the normal cycle fills it about half way. It is MUCH less water than washing the same dishes by hand. Also they come cleaner.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be perma-installed? I don't mind having the lines run, just need a smaller unit - no space for a built in.. but don't want to hook up faucet\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I tried to have that done and it would not have been good in my case as I was moving sone. But the handyman said it could be semi built in. It is an awesome dishwasher and I would purchase again.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Just received it but my faucet is a regular one with no threads. Any suggestions on what I should do?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure if I completely understand your issue, but I do know that I had an unconventional faucet and this youtube video solved all my problems! All it required was a pair of pliers. In fact, I didn't actually have to buy the part she buys in the video, so pull yours out and see if you need to buy one before you go out and spend the money. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bYG12CoNQW8 If this isn't what's going on with yours let me know and I'll see what I can do to help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: just opened the spt dishwasher: What does that mean?????\n Answer:","completion":" They fold up, actually, and snap into place. I almost never use mine, and use that space for frying pans and smaller pots.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What happens if the faucet is left running after the wash is complete? Do you need to be near the unit to promptly shut off the water after a wash?\n Answer:","completion":" I have left the faucet on in the past but try not to. I know how damage a burst hose could cause. My suggestion is to not leave the supply hose pressurised (faucet on) whenever possible.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the real dimentions? HxWxD??\n Answer:","completion":" 17-1\/8 H x 21-1\/2 W x 19-5\/8 deep, plus 2\" (so 21-5\/8\") when the hose is connected to the back\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you wait next to it and turn off the water as soon as it's done washing? Or does it fill and then you turn off the faucet &amp; it begins washing?\n Answer:","completion":" You'll get an instruction manual. It comes with an attachment for your faucet so it can couple with the water's input\/output. I preheat the water after connecting to faucet, turn on hot water and use red button (release valve) until it's coming out hot. Then choose your cycle and push start. There is a 10 second delay before it starts. You leave the water on until it beeps several times, telling you it's finished. You turn off dishwasher, turn off water, push the red release button on coupler (releases any water pressure) then you uncouple and then I pull the hose upward from the back to drain water still in hose. Certain cycles heat the water so you'll want to pull open the door and let the steam out and the dishes (hot) will finish drying. The manual is not written well, but it's not rocket science, so you'll figure it out. But you leave hot on until it finishes the cycle (also, the red light that flashes while running, goes solid red when cycle is over). It has a lot of options, so you'll want to read it carefully. But it's a good dishwasher. Which reminds me... I'd better load mine up... again :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the SPT Portable Countertop Dishwasher require a sink with a garbage disposal?\n Answer:","completion":" No.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is the hose? My counter on the sink side is too narrow, I may need to use the counter across my small galley style kitchen.\n Answer:","completion":" Its actually quite long. Most of my hose is coiled in the sink as my dishwasher is right next to the sink. The outlets for the hose is on the RIGHT side of the unit, so if you will be needing to put the dishwasher on the right side of the sink, the hoses will run behind the unit and you'll lose a good bit of length.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there any limitations as to what dishwasher detergent etc we can use?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes and no... You can use any powder or liquid\/gel dishwasher detergent you would like however if you choose to use the popular tablets, packs,pods, the owners manual says that you should use the longest cycle on the dishwasher so that the detergent us fully dissolved and properly rinsed away. I have never used the packs in my machine but understand the longer cycle, since the regular cycle uses only a little more than three gallons of water for the entire cycle. Hope this is helpful...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much water does the unit use in a cycle? How many Gallons?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't recall the exact amount but it is very low water use. Far less than if I washed by hand. As I recall the normal cycle only uses about 3 gallons for the entire cycle.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this machine in Chile?\n Answer:","completion":" Voltage required for this unit is 220. Chile's voltage is also 220. It should work fine.

{"prompt":"Question: My house runs on Propane from the town line, will this work with propane? What are the cut out dimensions? ?\n Answer:","completion":" I have propane also you just need to get the converter adapter from gas to propane\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be use for LP\n Answer:","completion":" Yes but you have to change orfic that comes with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit have a spin cycle if using as a washer? Or do you have to buy a separate spin dryer to remove the water from your clothes?\n Answer:","completion":" No, this washer does not have a spin dry function. Also, as a clothing washer I would highly recommend the Panda or Basecamp washers over this model. None of them have spin dry, so you will need a separate spinner. The small blue spinner works well. It operates at 1,600 RPM. This is quite a bit faster than a typical washing machines spin cycle. Those are normally about 600 RPM. The larger stainless steel drum spinner operates at 3,200 RPM and leaves your clothes dry enough to wear in a pinch. They will hang dry in only about an hour out of the faster machine. Buy whichever one suits your needs. Be aware that capacity wise the 3,200 RPM model more closely matches that of the Panda \/ Basecamp washer. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this washer for cloth? or just extracting some kind of herb or something like that? is it okay to wash my baby's cloth?\n Answer:","completion":" This machine, by design is a clothes washer, popular in Asia and many other (non USA) countries around the world. In this particular instance this one is re-branded and being sold with a 220 micron pouch for use as an extraction machine to make \"bubble hash\" out of marijuana. You can of course use it safely to wash your baby clothes. However, I would recommend the Panda or Basecamp washing machines over this model. This one has been marked up in price for no real reason, and the mesh bag will be of no use to you. It is not tough enough for clothing use. The Panda and basecamp machines are less expensive, and better models when it comes to reliability and motor power for clothes. This model is only about $30 USD in China! (Talk about killer profit here!) Anyway, I hope this helps you! Oh and on another note, none of these machines have a spin dry function. You will want to pick up the small blue spinner (1,600 ROM)for lighter things like the baby clothes, or the bigger 3,200 RPM for when you need things almost completely dry out of the spinner, or larger things spun. The larger spinner is much more expensive, and even the smaller one drys things much more than a typical washing machine spin cycle.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it extract water from wet clothes\n Answer:","completion":" no forced extraction but a drain hose and gravity.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it have to be hooked up to a faucet or do you just add water with a bucket also does it spin out the water\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with a cheesy faucet connector, easier to fill with a bucket or pitcher. Does not spin water out but does have a small drain hose on outside of machine. This machine is not for washing clothes, it is for making bubble hash extract. I suppose you could wash socks and underwear in it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of plastic is the machine made out of?\n Answer:","completion":" It is made almost all out of plastic. It is flimsy and jamns and stops. Through it away after a month. Drill with paddles and bubble bags is way to go. Best machine I use for maximum keif\/hash is from a dude that made 160 and 220 micron drums. They are placed in lined box. Put tumbler\/drum in a small freezer for 24 hours full of cruddy bud\/shake. Turn on small motor keeps a constant tumbling action in frozen element. More keif than you can believe!!!! NO STICKS!!!!!! Perforate drum. We have gathered over 10 pounds of keif from a f__ed up crop. Good luck.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this compatible with a Whirlpool model RCC3024RB02\n Answer:","completion":" The RCC3024 is obsolete so you would need to contact Whirlpool for information on that unit. If that is your existing cook top I would recommend lifting it out of the cut out and measuring your opening, front to back and side to side. Here are the specs for the W5CE3024XB: Overall Width: 30 13\/16\" Overall Depth: 21 3\/4\" Overall Height: 3 3\/4\" Cutout Width: 29 1\/2\" Cutout Depth: 20 1\/2\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: CAN YOU JUST PLUG IT IN ONCE IT IS SEATED?\n Answer:","completion":" You do need to provide an electric cord with a plug end on it to wire into the control box (or hardwire it direct), but it is a pretty simple wiring job that most do-it-yourselfers could handle. Length of cord required depends on the way you route.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you think buying 2 year protection plan for this is necessary or not? If not buying it, is the product automatically cover 1 year ?\n Answer:","completion":" I have the same one and have had it for quite a while. I did not buy the warranty and it has worked perfectly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I gather that this unit could be installed over a built-in under counter wall oven? But I need to be sure! Thank you for your help.\n Answer:","completion":" It will be fine above a built in oven as long as you have roughly 4 inches clearance below the top of the counter as this device sets in to the counter.

{"prompt":"Question: because the lights are on the back of the unit does it give sufficient lighting all over the stove?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello. Yes. It has three settings for lights. 1st, the lowest is to me is sufficient and the two and three settings (modiym and highest) should be enough. I think. Now one detail That has been bothering me is the vent\/fan is close to the wall and does not cover well the two front burners. But it is still an awesome appliance. And I would highly suggest you do everything possible to expel the air to the outside of the house. If you leave the air inside the hood I'm afraid to tell you, the exhaust is 85% inefficient.\n"}

I have heat lamp on the right side over my basking rock and food, water and night light on the other.\n Answer:","completion":" Place slightly above the basking rock, where it may be easily read. Also good to have one on the cool side near the height your reptile seems to mostly seek out. Good luck.\n"}

I do not have any 16 oz energy drink cans at home to test the capacity. It appears to me that it can very easily hold 16 oz size cans on both shelves.

{"prompt":"Question: How far will the unit push the exhaust effectively?\n Answer:","completion":" Its not the most powerful fan out there. I ran the one I have straight up and out the roof with an additional kit I purchased at home depot. It draws okay from the two back burners on my gas range. Its less effective with the front ones because they are farther away but its well made and looks very contemporary and clean.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what would we need to do to keep it from rattling once installed - my wall is dry wall in the area of hanging &amp; 2 studs identified -\n Answer:","completion":" We added a second pair of stainless screws on each side of the flue joint and they helped.

{"prompt":"Question: Is there an on\/off switch with this replacement ice maker?\n Answer:","completion":" Not a switch, a bar that can be raised up to stop the icemaker from making more ice.

{"prompt":"Question: do this one replace the WR30X10044? as well by General Electric ?\n Answer:","completion":" The short answer is probably yes. It has fittings for most installations. You might note that this unit makes seven cubes at a time. My original GE unit made eight at a time, as might yours. My original GE unit ran for something like sixteen years. This one has been running almost a year. I don't notice the difference in cube production. In my opinion, this unit's construction is very inferior to the original GE. I doubt that it will last for sixteen years, but who knows? The cost was much lower than any other exact (8 cube) replacement unit, GE or otherwise.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What type of warranty comes with this unit? I bought one from another supplier and they gave 30 day warranty and it broke at day 31.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know what kind of warranty it has but I have mine for a year now and it works great.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will it replace WR30X0327 icemaker\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it will. My OEM GE icemaker WR300X0327 stopped working and the ERWR30X10093 was a perfect replacement. It is making buckets of ice.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do I need a special Power Cord to plug this and the non-duct kit into a standard wall outlet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you would need to somehow attach a cord to the bare wires in order to plug it into a standard wall outlet. You would also need the non duct kit. I bought it and had a duct made for it. I really like the hood.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What's is the minimum and maximum distance allowed between the bottom of hood and range top?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it was listed as 18\"-21\" for electric ranges.

{"prompt":"Question: does the shelf come with it?\n Answer:","completion":" no, but you can purchase matching backsplash with shelves (see Broan site)...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What non ducted recirculation kit should you use this range hood with? I do not not have outside vent\n Answer:","completion":" I do not have non ducted install.

{"prompt":"Question: what is the overall minimum height on this? I am looking for 22-24\" high. Diagram ht seems to point to chimney ht not overall ht. thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" The chimney flue comes in two sections. You can mount the fan using only the upper brackets and one of the outer chimney covers to have a short height hood. If necessary, you can cut the chimney cover and brackets to make them even shorter. How low is your ceiling? You need to allow enough room above your stove to use your pots and not hit your head on the hood.\n"}

I took it down and replaced it with another Maytag filter and its doing great now. I'll only buy the Maytag filters from now on. Best of luck to you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the filter label indicate the number of gallons of water it will treat or flow rate ? Do you notice a difference in water flow rate ?\n Answer:","completion":" Kirin reports 1137 liters\/3000 gallons but 1137 liters is only 300 gallons, not 3000.

It was only after I gave it a very strong turn to the right and heard a new click I hadn't heard before that I knew I installed it correctly and water began to flow. I'm not the handiest person but I can hold my own. This was a very tricky install in my opinion and requires some patience and strength.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this fit a Jenn Air refrigerator\n Answer:","completion":" From my home work-yes, BUT I have since thrown both of them in the trash. I wrote a review that stated why but in the end the weight was off, to lite, the water passed through as fast as when the filter was bypassed and I felt the water was not properly filtered. In the end I spent a little more and bought a couple of Maytag brand which also fit our Kitchen Aid. And now the water flows at the same rate as when the refer was new.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have Kenmore Refrigerator model #10655234400 in white color. any idea about color and if it will fit kenmore\n Answer:","completion":" The product description for the Whirlpool Bin does not include any Kenmore models, but since Kenmore and Whirlpool may be similar refrigerators, you might check the dimensions of the bin in your refrigerator and see if it is the same as the whirlpool model. As for color, white is probable standard. I think I would look up your refrigerator model and see what parts are listed for that particular refrigerator. If the height, width and depth match your refrigerator bin you could order the part and give it a try. If it does not fit, you can send it back.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a refrigerator, Whirlpool model WSF26C2EXY02, I need to know if it will fit the door and if its the one that 2 gallons of milk will fit in?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. I bought the bin for a Kenmore refrigerator, which is probably made by Whirlpool. The opening of the bin is about 6 by 13 inches, so two one-gallon containers of milk will probably fit in it, but I don't think you would want to put that much weight in it. I bought this as a replacement for one of mine that the hook on one end broke off of, probably because of too much weight in it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can I wash king size sheet set in the SQ AWN542?\n Answer:","completion":" Easy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We wash work clothes that have grease &amp; farm dirt on the jeans. How does the Speed Queen do on heavily soiled items?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know about grease but my Speed Queen AWN542 works very well on yard dirt. It has a powerful agitator. Plus all Speed Queen top loaders have a soak cycle that should help with the grease but I have not had to use it yet. One minor nit with the soak cycle is that after it is done you then have to run the load through a entire regular cycle but an easy workaround suggested by other owners is to use the regular cycle but lift the lid on the washer after the initial fill to let the load soak. After it soaks for a while just close the iid to run the load through the rest of the cycle. You can't do this with a modern HE machine. The only other recommendations I have is to use lots of water (easy with a Speed Queen) and don't overload the machine (especially with jeans.)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is the size so small? 3.3 cu ft seems pretty small compared to what is on the market. I wash pretty big loads of clothes.\n Answer:","completion":" The size is sufficent to wash large loads we have a family of 4-6 depending on how is in town. Don't be fooled by the large sizes other washers. I had a front load that said 4.0 and it could not affectively wash that size load. I have owned a lot of washers this truly and old fashion machine that really works. You tube all the other brands and you will see all the horror stories and complaints. Size don't matter you need a machine that works. The tub could 10 cu ft but if you cannot get clean clothes its worthless.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: model 542 has a fabric selector switch...what is the purpose and do you find it helpful?\n Answer:","completion":" The AWN542 has a fabric selector switch that separates control of the agitation and spin selection speeds from the timer. This option gives the user more control over the wash cycle when compared to other models. All other models incorporate the agitation and spin operations into the cycle selection timer. A KNITS or DELICATE fabric selection with a REGULAR or PERMANENT PRESS cycle selection delivers a constant slow agitation coupled with selectable fast or slow extraction spin. None of the other models operate with the constant slow agitation feature in a complete cycle. The AWN542 continues to incorporate traditional Delicate and Hand Wash cycles that utilize intermittent slow agitation, extended soaks, and slow speed spins to perform a gentle wash. Another unique option is the ability in the SOAK cycle to use a fast or slow agitation and spin extraction.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone else experienced ripped jeans or pants in their Speed Queen as one reviewer mentioned? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" We have not experienced ripped jeans or any clothing in ours. We did however have a full sized comforter torn while trying to wash it in this machine. It was no fault of the machine, the comforter clearly stated front load machines only. It was far too large to be washed in this washer. After half a year or so with this machine we still love it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit have an agitator\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, Mark this washer does have an agitator. I have put the washer through it's paces since delivery and have washed bath rugs in it, the heavy cotton bath rugs that weigh a ton when wet. This machine has done so with finesse and with out bouncing around. I will try to upload pics of the agitator for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is the average wash cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" Our average wash cycle (i.e., normal regular or normal perm press) with our average load (large setting) seems to go about 30-35 minutes. Add in an extra rinse cycle and it is about 45 minutes. No issue for us since this is still faster than our Whirlpool WED4850 dryer (which we also like a lot).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How noisy is this machine? Would you put it in a room next to your bedroom?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say the sound level is mostly 'average' -- no beeps or buzzes, but lots of swishing and humming. However, the loudest part is actually quite loud, and lasts maybe 30 seconds. The first time I heard it, I thought something was wrong with the washer, but after talking to a technician, was assured it was normal. I think it happens at the end of the rinse cycle, when the tub is spinning very fast, and water is pouring in for the rinse, and the clothes are getting compressed against the side. Due to this, at some point the clothes are no longer covering the bottom of the washer, and the water pouring in is hitting the empty bottom of the metal tub directly. This sound of water hitting the tub is startling, and probably child-waking loud if it's near their room.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this basket fit the 5 cu ft. GE freezer?\n Answer:","completion":" This basket has been recommended for a 7 cu ft. freezer. The 5RGR1 would be more for a 5 cu ft. size. (PTP Supply is currently out of stock of the 5RGR1).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: One thing says the depth is 18 inches one answer says the length is 18 inches.

{"prompt":"Question: Does it keep the ice frozen like a freezer after the ice is made\n Answer:","completion":" It does not, it doesn't melt immediately but if you left it for quite sometime it melts. It would be nice to have a unit that dropped it into a freezer then continued to make more. We do really like it though...great for camping!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many volts are required to run this unit?\n Answer:","completion":" We use it in our RV just plugged into a standard plug.\n"}

I plugged the fridge back in, and voila! After a cycle or two, the fridge was kickin' ice out better than it had for a long time. I sure would love to know if this works for you!\n"}

My particular grill also has 2 small plastic tabs along the bottom that mount into 2 small holes that act as support and guides as you press the grill into place.

Has anyone used this device on a house that has well water and a water softener?\n Answer:","completion":" I have well water and a softener, and high iron content. I purchased this product about a year ago, and it worked great for a few weeks (strong ozone smell). Then the ozone smell stopped. I sent it back to greentech environmental and they replaced it free of charge. Then the same problem occurred. They recommended I \"backwash\" the unit, where you reverse the connections, and flow water backwards. This fixed the problem! Apparently small particles can clog the ozone generator. Now I backflush the unit after every 4 loads (once a week), and that has worked over the past 9 months. Also am using a smaller (1 micron) sediment filter, instead of 30 micron, ahead of the softener.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: does the Pure wash cause any kind of problems with a septic system???\n Answer:","completion":" Not at all. I have been using it over a year now with a septic system. If anything, it is better for it as you aren't releasing detergent into it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long will the pure wash last\n Answer:","completion":" Mine has been working for 14 months for a family of four and we haven't purchased laundry detergent in all that time. Purchased the High Efficiency version - ran it for a standard washer for about 4 months and then replaced the washer with a high efficiency 10 months ago. Because it generates the gases when it runs, I see no reason why it won't last for a long time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have an HE top load Kenmore Elite. Which model do need?\n Answer:","completion":" Low Flow model\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is it made?\n Answer:","completion":" China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i have a high efficiency washer. Since the price is the same can i use the high flow model on a low flow machine?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Due to the small amount of water used in an HE washer the Purewash designed for HE washers has a small output and concentrated ozone action. If you use the high flow on an HE washer you will get very poor results from your Purewash due to the diluted ozination.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the gray water from the washer be used to water plants or will the change in pH affect the plants?\n Answer:","completion":" The gray water would only contain water (H2O), Ozone (O3), Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), and whatever dirt would be on your clothes. Hydrogen Peroxide is only slightly acidic at 6.2 on the ph scale so it shouldn't be enough of a change to make a difference in your plants.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how high will this raise my washer? I have a pedestal drawer and need to get 3\/4\" higher.\n Answer:","completion":" The vibration pads have a 1\/4 inch inset for the feet of the pedestal or washer\/dryer to sit in. The pads will raise your pedestal 1.25 inches, and this is before you make any height adjustments with the pedestal drawer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If you have a pedestal, do you have to get two sets of these or just one?\n Answer:","completion":" I only put one set. I placed them under the pedestal on the floor. Still working good !\n"}

If you search the bellow & model number it should come up. If it says that it's for a Whirlpool washer then it will work, that's who makes the HE2 machines.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you wait 24 hours before plugging in for first time ?\n Answer:","completion":" I would wait the 24 hrs. The reason being that if it were to ship on its side, the oil in the compressor would drain away from the motor. The compressor needs all the oil to live a long and happy life\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: do you have deforst?\n Answer:","completion":" This is a different frig. There is no frozen food compartment. I have found, by experience, that models that have the frozen food compartment , it is useless. This model has a plate that covers the back of the whole compartment. The cooling coils are behind that. There is an automatic defrost with a drip pan that takes care of any frost build up. It works very well and is quiet.

{"prompt":"Question: Is this Danby model suitable for outdoor use?\n Answer:","completion":" This model is excellent as a cooler for canned drinks and vegetables.

PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this refrigerator and the manufacturer in general at any cost! Hope this helps you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be built in your kitchen with cabinets around it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.

We have had ours a year now and are very pleased with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you exchange the singe tap for a double tap on this unit?\n Answer:","completion":" If you're asking if Danby will do that for you, I can't answer that.

{"prompt":"Question: Can you put this under a counter and mount the tap on the counter? Will there be a large hole in the top of the fridge I will have to insulate?\n Answer:","completion":" I put mine under counter and mounted tap to counter.

{"prompt":"Question: 'What size is the faucet threads 5\/8 or 7\/8\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry I have no idea. I bought a Danby and ended up returning it for their TERRIBLE customer service. It didn't work for me and their customer service was the worst. Just fair warning.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does anyone know if this will work if the dishwasher is sitting lower than the sink?\n Answer:","completion":" There is nothing in the Instruction Manual that says anything about the height of the Washer related to the sink, so I'm assuming that it wouldn't be considered as a problem. A pump does pump out the used water after each cycle, so with only a 4 foot set of hoses, I doubt the height of the Washer would be an issue. It would of course be wise to go on-line to Danby and check with them. The Danby countertop Washers are great when you don't have the room for a full sized Washer. This is the 3rd one I've had as they do have a life span of only 2 to 3 years, but for the price, replacing them isn't all that bad.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be mounted under the counter?\n Answer:","completion":" It is not designed for that. It does need to connect to the faucet. But with the proper tools, space, and engineuity I suppose you could make it work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long are the wash cycles?\n Answer:","completion":" The longest one, the heavy is 1 hour 45 minutes, normal 1:25, light 1:15, glass 1:10, speed 45minutes and soak 10 minutes. The dishes do not come out fully dried when it finishes, they may have some water drops on them still. So what I do is open it when the cycle is done and leave it open for ten more minutes, then they fully dry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The only area this will fit is to put it sideways. Would there be problems, and how long are the hoses?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think you can put it sideways - probably would leak. Maybe Nick B can share the product he bought.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this run quietly?\n Answer:","completion":" When im in watching tv you dont even notice it until it changes the water because it drains in your sink. or at the end it beeps telling you it is done I am very happy with mine.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have small rental units. a couple of questions- where does the unit drain? Are there drain hoses? Do you have to continuously connect to faucet?\n Answer:","completion":" can connect and unconnect to faucet pretty quickly (locks in) but if you dont have a standard faucet head it may be annoying or impossible. the units drain into the sink, there are 2 hoses, one going in and one goes out back into sink.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I prefer hand washing my table settings but don't do not always have time to hand dry. Can you use this to dry only?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Sorry. There's no dry setting. There's also the fact that it doesn't always leave your dishes dry at the end. In fact, it almost never opens at the end of a cycle without spraying you with water droplets. Never stand so your face clears the door when you're opening at the end of a cycle. That's the Splash Zone.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is there a web sight for the internal wiring for the lights they stopped working\n Answer:","completion":" I was able to get the document set which included the wiring diagram; but I don't remember just how I did that since it has been a couple of years now. I believe I researched the mfg name, the searched via Google for documents online. That worked for me and it was free. Just a note of caution; our ceiling is only 7' (dropped for a design reason) so hoods like this one will either hang low or will requir an expensive modification (fabrication). If you ceiling is at least 8' you are good to go.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the lights halogen or what?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes halogen or u could use led\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: installation\n Answer:","completion":" What is the question?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone tell me what the minimum height from the ceiling this hood can be? I don't want to exceed 24\", just want to be sure it can be adjusted.\n Answer:","completion":" If you are talking about the height above the range top, it should be about 28 - 32 inches. My installation is 29 inches, the governing factor is you don't want to hit your head on the vent unit when you lean over whatever you are cooking. The fan motor is powerful enough that we rarely use the high setting. As to adjustment, the unit as provided has the ability to adjust, but in my case, the ceiling was tilted and slightly too high, so I had an extended stainless duct piece fabricated (~$130) to make it all work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone tell me what's the minimum height of this hood? I have a very low ceiling and the height of the hood has to be less than 25 inches. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I cut mine to fit. I have a 8.5foot ceiling\n"}

After around three weeks of it sounding like a generator running in my kitchen, it finally got repaired. But now, after a few months of quiet operation, it's beginning to get loud again. Looks nice on the outside, but all LG (Lackluster Garbage) on the inside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This item has a smaller ice maker. Does it make ice quickly? Is the ice always empty after use?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe from my experience that the ice maker makes ice upon demand. The lower the freezer temperature, the faster the ice is made\n"}

(I'm not a repair technician just a person with tools and determination to DIY) What I have done for both my washer and dyer (if you haven't already) is search for the model number and the part needed. So for you... search - Kenmore 110.86983810 dryer heater element - and then search AMAZON for the part number (I have purchased from the parts supplier and Amazon - since I have prime I go Amazon if the part is available) So in your case ... http:\/\/www.repairclinic.com\/PartDetail\/b6p8\/Kenmore-Dryer-Heating-Element-Assembly\/3387747\/525502?modelNumber=110.86983810&ss=a8b6d502079&mr=1 Which gives you the part number &lt;&lt;Whirlpool OEM Part #3387747&gt;&gt; Which is this one - so I would say it should work. Very easy to replace. Have your shop vac handy you will be amazed at how much lint build up there is. Also make sure your exhaust duct is clean too. I believe my heater element failed because of the lint backed up in the exhaust duct. I don't believe the lint catcher is as effective as it could be so the dryer is on my yearly schedule now to clean the lint out of the exhaust duct and to open the front bottom panel and clean out the unit.

{"prompt":"Question: do I need to buy anything,to hook it up to an island ceiling\n Answer:","completion":" Depends... Are you replacing a hood? If so, does it vent to the outside? The blower needs a way to vent to the outside through a hard lined vent. A flex hose vent will create additional noise. You need to supply it with 120V power. It must be secured to joists in the ceiling, drywall anchors will not support the weight. If you are replacing a hood, you probably have most of these elements already installed. If not, you will need to hire someone to install unless you know how to do these things yourself. It isn't worth spending the money and risk having it fall down in the process.

I'm trying to connect this to a pump that will turn on when the temperature has reached 130F and then run for 10 minutes and turn off. Is that possible with...\n Answer:","completion":" No..It is designed to turn on and off at temperature set points. There isn't any way to control the \"time\" when it hits a set point. The only time setting is in-between the low shut off point and the high turn on point. If you were heating in a refrigerator with an element then it shuts off it is here you have control of the time..(it's called controlling the \"short cycle\")..after it shuts off there will be some residual heat at first then it will be absorbed or dissipate in short time...like 8-10minutes. So you set the \"lag\" time for like 15minutes, so then the controller will not check the temperature for 15min. THEN turn off if it needs to cool down more. That is the only time control in this controller. The only way to work in your case is you would need to place a 10min. timer between your controller and the pump. the problem being is you'll need a timer that re-sets after it shuts off..Not easy,but not impossible either!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how do I turn on the drying cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" This machine does not have a drying cycle. That didn't bother me because I haven't used one most of the time for years (to save energy). What I do is time my load (whenever possible) so that I am around when the cycle ends. Then I turn it off, open the door, pull out the top rack to keep the door partly open, and let the dishes air dry.

{"prompt":"Question: The picture you have listed is backwards from the part i Have in my Whirlpool Duet Sport washer. In my washer the pump is on the right of the drain trap. Is this just an image thing? Also, I have the pump removed from the assembly, is there any reason...\n Answer:","completion":" The picture is actually upside down. The picture shows the mounting feet on the top while when installed in the machine the feet point down and are attached to the base of the washer. Another interesting aspect of the picture of a pump is that they managed to hide the attachment points of the two hoses. The inlet hose attaches to the back of the trap chamber on the left foreground of the picture. The trap keeps change and other debris from entering the pump. The pump itself is in the middle of the picture. The outlet extends at a 45 angle and cannot be seen becaust it is directly on the other side of the pump. The tan cap covers the motor and is normally on the right. Other than showing the pump rotated 180, the pump is in the correct orientation in the machine. You can open and empty the trap from the front without removing the pump. Removing the pump is tricky as you have to depress the black rubber padding on the feet in just the right way in order to remove the pump. Search YouTube for videos on how to do this. Be prepared for water! Since the pump is located at the bottom of the machine it cannot pump out all the water. Using a wet-vac to suck water out of the exaust tube gets rid of most of it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the pump i\"m replacing list # 854oo26 on it will this work\n Answer:","completion":" Whirlpool W10130913 Water Pump for Washer was the recommended part (by several internet sites) to replace the original part in our Kenmore HE2 plus washer.

{"prompt":"Question: In the product picture above, is that yellow pump casing supposed to have any water inside?\n Answer:","completion":" Emile D., Sorry for the delay in my response I just opened your email. The pump casing should not have any water in it. You may have a leaking seal in the pump itself or you may have a leaking seal in washing tub\/drum that leaks water on to the pump. Either way the entire area in which this pump is located should be dry. Perhaps the pump can dried out. It might work if it is not shorted out. Fix the leak first. If there is water in the casing, the cause of the water must be remedies before you put in any new pump. Visually inspect the seals and repair or replace as necessary.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Anyone know the difference between W10130913 and PS1960402?

{"prompt":"Question: Do I have to change the whole part or can I just replace the motor part?\n Answer:","completion":" The motor and pump are a unit and replaced together.

Should only take about half an hour to change.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this works on my Kenmore Elite Oasis HE washer Model 11027092603\n Answer:","completion":" The part is correct, you can verify it at the Sears Parts Direct Site, \"http:\/\/www.searspartsdirect.com\/partsdirect\/part-model\/Kenmore-elite-Parts\/Washer-Parts\/Model-11027092603\/0583\/0153200\/K0702024\/00001\" The the original part number is 8564009 which has been replaced by the Whirlpool W10189077 suspension kit which makes it the current replacement part for your washer. If you cannot cut and paste the link, then go to \"www.searspartsdirect.com\" and enter your Model number in the search box, then go to the \"Top and Cabinet\" diagram, the suspension is item #10. After verifying the part, then I would go and find the best overall deal, (part + S\/H + Tax). It does take a little work to get the old parts out, and the new parts in. Also in my washer, the \"new\" suspension part was a little different (well, more like improved). I'm not sure about your Kenmore Washer, but I installed a new \"improved\" wash plate in my Whirlpool, and it seems to help reduce some of the twisting of clothing (the new impeller has three tall\/long and three small \"blades\" and they are all narrow, the old impeller had three large\/wide raised areas). Bottom line, my washer is as good as new, no more banging and \"OL\" codes. It was well worth the effort to save the big bucks of having someone come out... I used Google to find a service manual for my washer, it had some better info on how to open the washer, there were some self-help videos on Youtube as well. Best of luck!!!\n"}

The device is a little heater coil that imposes an artificially warmer temperature on the refrig temperature controller that \"fools\" it into thinking that it must turn on to preserve the cooling in both sections of the fridge\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the stainless steel door magnetic?\n Answer:","completion":" You probably did not read my feedback. I never received the thing, because the on-line Merchant had lied about it having been shipped. My advice is that if you are buying something from a \"Amazon marketplace\" from NYC, Miami, NJ assume that they are lying. You will have bad experience (usually out of stock). The West coast people are better since they actually receive most of the stuff from Pacific where things are usually manufactured, and they have not lost all their honesty. Even Midwest and Southwest, including Texas are largely honest. This is result of a clustering problem I ran, and data does not lie. Of course there are always exceptions.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this the BEST countertop, electric washer there is out there?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! I believe so! Being single and on a tight budget this has come in very handy! My apartment has my water and electric included in the rent so I purchased this washer and a spinner as well. I don't have to lug my laundry to the laundry room, hope I have enough money to wash and dry, nor do I have to worry about any of my clothes being stolen. The only small flaw that I have found this to have is that if you have thick plush towels the size of beach towels, it will not work correctly as the weight of the towel is too heavy for this, even if you just wash one at a time. I only have two such towels that I use when I go to the pool and all my other towels are the standard size and those I can wash two at a time. when it is time to wash my comforters which right now I am not using until winter time I will have to go to the laundry mat to wash those. But back to the plush towels, I just wash those by had in the kitchen sink and rinse them then I put them in the spinner and they will come out almost dry. I have gotten my monies worth on this product as I wash every week and I even wash my queen size bed sheets, flat and fitted in this washer, one at a time, of course of it beats them getting stolen from the washer in the laundry mat and having to buy new ones! I have also bought a grey colored hose from home depot to use to fill the washer faster with water because the hose it comes with is too small and it takes forever. I have only spent $6.00 for the hose and I have used both powder and also liquid detergent in this washer. If you like powder, fill washer first then add the powder and stir so the powder can dissolve, then add the close. It's just a little extra work but I would do it than spend $10 a week and having to sit there and wait for the clothes to wash, this way while I wash, I can do other house work or watch tv because once I don't hear the timer anymore then I know it stopped. I hope this helps! :) One more thing, if you can find a small table to sit it on, I have a small table that is lower than the sink but so this way when it's time to let the water out I just unhook the attached hose into the tub and let it drain. I don't even squeeze the excess water out of the clothes because you don't have to use more than a tablespoon of detergent. I just put clean water and set the timer to 15 minutes and let it rinse, then I let the water out again, take the clothes out and put it in the spinner and set that timer to two minutes and my clothes is clean and almost dry. I hang them to dry on hangers on this clothes rack and 30 minutes later, my clothes is dry. The thickness of the clothes depends on the time. I also set the clothes near the A\/C vent so it dries quicker.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This doesn't need to drain while in operation? I am a truck driver and would like to place it in seat, want to make sure it doesnt shoot water out\n Answer:","completion":" It has a drain when the drain hose is unhooked & lowered.

The original hose is still intact and in use (many complain it breaks; not mine). Have had no complaints so far.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the washer move around a lot when in operation? Anyone tried the Laundry Alternative mini washer plus with rinse cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Not really This washer is for small wash like baby cloth and it is small\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does itspin the cloths\n Answer:","completion":" The unit agitates the clothes during washing by spinning one direction, pausing, then spinning the opposite direction. The time is set with a manual timer. It does not spin to remove water. Normally I put clothes in and let them soak; then agitate approx. 10 min.; soak; agitate around 10 min. Then drain, remove clothes and wring out, replace clothes to rinse, and duplicate timing. I rinse twice. Watch that you don't use too much detergent - it doesn't take much. With too much, you'll have to rinse more times. With the first few loads, I have to rinse 5 or more times to get all the detergent out. I I'd like to find a small roller wringer (like old washing machines) to go with this unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: HOW DO YOU PUT THE WATER IN THE WASHER\n Answer:","completion":" It has a hose that hooks to the faucet on your kitchen sink. It just slips onto it. If it doesn't fit your sink (it fits most sinks), then you could simply pour half gallon pitchers of water into it till you get it about 3\/4 full. Put clothes in first and then fill it. When the wash cycle is over, place the drain house in the sink and let it drain and then refill it for the rinse cycle. Six minutes seems to get our clothes really clean. Then 3 minutes for the rinse cycle. Less time because you have less clothing in it than with a full size washer. Overfilling the machine with too many clothes makes agitation (movement of machine to clean) impossible. Overfilling with water will cause some water to leak out the drain hose which is hooked in an upward position during wash and rinse cycles to keep it from prematurely draining. Machine fits pretty easily on the counter next to sink. You need only a small amount of laundry soap for each wash. It does not spin dry the clothes. You will need to wring them out or buy a small spin dryer. You could also place the machine on a table or counter and put a bucket under it for when you need to drain it. You could fill it via a garden hose. It seems to work well with cold or warm water.\n"}

I installed it myself - fairly easy and it came with everything I needed including a new regulator. As some reviewers noted, the grate does sit a bit high, but the flame is much hotter than my old standard GE cooktop, and the center 3-ring burner gets really hot - works well on my wok. The griddle is a nice touch and works as expected (the specialized burner control is handy), but it's a bit of a storage challenge. It's a good thing we have lots of storage in our kitchen. So far, so good.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How thick are the grates? A similar GE cooktop has grates that are too thick and prevents the flame from contacting the bottom of cookware.\n Answer:","completion":" The grates are pretty thick and very heavy. I have found that I have to use a higher flame on this cooktop than I used on my old one. But my old cooktop was very, very old. Takes a little longer to start heating, boiling, etc. but overall it cooks wonderfully.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the actual installed width of the cooktop?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm pretty sure it's standard 36'. If you call company they'll give you min and max deminsions.

{"prompt":"Question: I bought this and tried to install it. There are gaps just at the rounded corners between the cooktop and the granite.

{"prompt":"Question: My Cafe series appliances have a grey logo, the picture shows a red logo. What color logo will I receive?\n Answer:","completion":" Production changes at GE in March of 2013 on the Cafe series appliances included the new dark gray\/black logo, replacing the red logo. I would think that all of the red logo Cafe appliances would have long ago been sold, but it probably wouldn't hurt to contact the retailer to verify that you would be receiving new stock with the latest color logo. I haven 't seen any red logo Cafe appliances in quite some time at local stores. I have seen plenty of advertising with the old red logo displayed, but likely that would be the retailers continuing to use older advertising material.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are the inside dimensions enough to store a store bought pizza?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Unless you take each slice and wrap it in tinfoil\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the lights be replaced with brighter ones?\n Answer:","completion":" I just took it apart to look at those LED light housings. They are very easy to access. I loosened the four screws that hold down the glass cover, lifted it up a bit and could easily see the light housings. They are held in only with a clip, and by pushing down they come out easily. (You could probably just pry them out from underneath with a thin knife blade, working carefully so as not to scratch the surface.) The housing is connected with a plug to the 12V DC circuit that powers the LEDS. You can dismantle the housing by removing 4 small (PH-0) Philips head screws. That allows you to see the circular circuit board that holds 9 surface-mounted LEDs. The device is rated 12 Volts DC and less than 2 watts, meaning the current draw is less than 0.167 amps. Someone who knows the current market in LED surface mount devices could probably locate a circular board of similar size that contained some higher lumen output LEDs. (The technology on these is improving rapidly.) Or the manufacturer could get smart and get some themselves and offer us replacement plug-in units. But none of this helps you now. I was surprised how bright the 9 little bulbs were, and first thought maybe the diffuser was the problem in diminishing light output. But when I held the circuit board up in position without the diffuser and turned off the kitchen light, I could still see that the output was too slight. Anyway, although it doesn't immediately solve our problem of a low-lumen light, it was fun research. I took pictures, but can't figure out how they might be posted here.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I ordered this hood with the carbon filter so i could use it as a ventless,ductless unit, please tell me its possible, Is it ventless too?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it's quite possible. No need for ducts, but make sure you have the carbon filters. If the filters are not installed, all the exhaust will filter into your walls\/ceilings which is not good. Installation is pretty easy, but you also need 2 people because it's heavy. Also, if you can use toggle bolts to secure the vent to the ceiling, much more secure than the items they give you. It's a nice looking vent, I would for sure recommend.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: After we trimmed the chimney it left a black line of melted material around the edge. Tried to remove with goo gone and it won't come off. help!\n Answer:","completion":" Try a stainless steel pad, very gently. I cut mine down and did not have that problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a 7ft 8in ceiling. Will this range hood work for that? Also, we don't want the hood the hand more than 24 inches from the ceiling.\n Answer:","completion":" the hood range is designed to remove steam and odors from cooking. find a book at the library\/google it on maximum distance from the stove top to the lower hood. If the hood range is too far a distance from the stove top than you have defeated the purpose of the product, the range hood is adjustable, I built a frame for the hood range since it weighs over 50# and used 8 screws to hold up the range. I did not use the screws that came with the range, JUNK. I used 3.5 inch deck screws with washers, total 8, drilled my own holes for the mounting plate. the most difficult task is connecting the vent tube, since it is metric and not standard, will be challenging because it will not fit into the 6 inch vent, need to stretch the vent collar. Just remember the vent is adjustable for height. get a piece of string and tape to ceiling and cut to length of range height. from the bottom of the string measure the distance from your stove top, is it within proper ventilation height requirements from stove top to the bottom of the hood range. Most important will this pass a home inspection IF you sell your home one day. Use foil metal tape to secure the connections seams, available at Home depot.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the shortest height that the chimney can be adjusted to? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Best I managed was 25 inches. Its not ideal, its right at eye level. If anyone was able to get it shorter, I'd be interested in hearing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you provide installation instructions for this model? i am not sure I have enough room and want to check it before I buy.\n Answer:","completion":" It is an island hood so you do need some space for it. You also need electricity, ducting and another person to help put it up. It's a great looking unit. The stainless scratches easily so you have to be very careful when installing it. The vent stack is adjustable so you have wiggle room on the height. Do follow the instructions carefully. They are very specific about how far above the range it must be so as to maximize the ventilation.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is there any advantage having a LCD display unit over the standard button unit. Also handy man is asking $600 to install it with vent. Is it fair?\n Answer:","completion":" Nice to have the timer and clock display. We are using the ventless option on it so our install was minimal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you set the clock on the led display?\n Answer:","completion":" When the fan is off, keep touching the clock button for at least 3 seconds. The clock should start flashing. Then use the Fan button to set the hour and the Light button to set the minutes. Hit clock again and it should work. Note it only displays military time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the dimension of the hood shaft that goes into the ceiling\n Answer:","completion":" We have this attractive hood as well. I'm not sure of the shaft itself but the outside box that covers the shaft is an 12 incheby 12 inch. Our handyman tossed the bracket hardware and accordian type vent pipe. He felt both were lightweight and for few dollars did his own upgrade. It is very attractive once installed. We were left with a small ceiling hole and just used a crown molding type trim that matched our new cabinets to close it all in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone tell me what's the minimum height of this hood? I have a very low ceiling and the height of the hood has to be less than 25 inches. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Don't really know the answer. The installers had to cut down the height of the hood but it still is over 25 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What's the difference between the GVAI-30 and this one other than the clock? I don't see anything in the specs to say otherwise.\n Answer:","completion":" Only difference is the clock display\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you change the lights in the fan\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't had to do it yet but I pulled out the instructions that came with it. Wording is confusing but I followed instructions and then in mine is mounted over an island. I can see the wires and arrows referred to in instructions when I look from the back side of unit. I don't want to take it apart - but if you haven't looked from the back side that might help. If I could figure out how to insert a picture I woukd send that and a picture of the (confusing) manual page. If those might be helpful to you, I'd be happy to email them to you but I'm not sure how to get my email address to you without posting it here.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this hood be wall mounted?\n Answer:","completion":" No. This hood cannot be wall mounted. It is meant to be mounted to hang from the ceiling.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it ventless\/ductless\n Answer:","completion":" No. It vents to a duct which is then vented outside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this range hood work for a 7ft 71\/2 inch ceiling? We also do not want the hood to hang lower their 22 inches from the ceiling.\n Answer:","completion":" My ceilings are 7 1\/2 ft.. And it hangs 22'' from ceiling.. But I do have the stack venting out through the roof..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used as a ductless system? If so, what is needed?\n Answer:","completion":" No. I dont think you can. It is not set up like that. In order for the unit to be ductless you would have to change and modify inside parts cap off the existing exhaust , replace filters, and cut out another vent right above the glass for air to recycle. Similar to the standard hoods. It can get very expensive to modify.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the dimensions of the ceiling opening? I need a hood with the ceiling opening that is no more that 12'' (one foot) wide.\n Answer:","completion":" My Joice are 18\" apart, the chimney outer dimensions are 12\"x11\" I made opening of 9\" diameter in the ceiling that was enough to work and mount the bracket. The vent pipe is 6\" diameter. Here is the video that will help you determine how to mount the bracket. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Tr4VrAWKe3A.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Must this vent hood be venter to the outside air? I live in a condo and am not allowed to break walls leading to the outside.\n Answer:","completion":" The manufacturer does offer a filter for units that can not vent to the outside, the option should be available when you order.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the demensions of the air stack? I cant seemt find this info.\n Answer:","completion":" It's 12x13 on the sides and it has an adjustable height. Wear gloves when installing it... mine & my husbands hands were full of \"paper like\" cuts by the time we got it installed. lol\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this vent to the outside\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, in my case through the ceiling\n"}

The lights are proprietary and not replaceable with any off the shelf parts. If one. Breaks or goes out you will have trouble, from my experience you will have a hard time reaching anyone who can help you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This hood is for 8-9 foot ceilings. What extention would fit for a 12 foot ceiling?\n Answer:","completion":" I installed on a 12 foot ceiling and it worked perfect. I did built a cedar wood chase to screw the stainless steel chase from out side. It looks really nice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between a regular oven and a convection oven?\n Answer:","completion":" It has to do with the heat distribution. The convection has a fan to circulate the heat for more even cooking. It's especially good for baked goods.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would you buy the 5 burner again if you knew that it would not heat up like you hoped it would?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it heats fine. Even they smallest burner in the back will keep a large pot of sauce\/liquid simmering on the lowest setting. The front burners are very strong, much hotter than any stove I have owned before. I use the middle burner for very large pots, or griddles. We have 3 kids, cook and bake everyday. I love this stove and would definitively buy it again. However, we had to adjust the burners when we bought it, because the flames were too low.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: griddle\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know what you want to know about the griddle. I use the big center burner for canning or anything needing a large pan. Have used it as a griddle and love it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Some reviewers talk about grilling and others using a griddle. Are there different parts that swap out in the middle or are they the same?\n Answer:","completion":" The stove comes with a single griddle (which is a flat surface). I'd imagine that some people purchase 3rd party grills\/skillets (with ridged surfaces).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there a matching range hood?\n Answer:","completion":" We had installed a Samsung microwave with the hood SMH9207ST included knowing we were going to change the stove eventually. The microwave and stove really finishes out newly remodeled kitchen............\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the burners be lit during a power outage? I live in an area of common ice storms, so that's a make or break for me.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you just have to use a match or a lighter. However I would not purchase this range, our oven will not hold a consistent temperature, some days it is right on, the next day it is 50 degrees off. We have had repair folks out three times and they say nothing is wrong. I would not recommend this product to anyone.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i use it when there is a power failure\n Answer:","completion":" you would be able to manually light the burners with a match\/lighter, but the oven would not work, nor would the electric ignitor\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this product come with a conversion kit?\n Answer:","completion":" I assume you mean a kit to convert from natural gas (the default) to LP gas. Yes, the range does comes with parts which are inside a metal box on the rear of the range and pretty thorough instructions on how to convert it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the upp and lower ovens are BOTH gas and convection, or just one or the other. Can anyone clarify? trying to decide between this and profile.\n Answer:","completion":" Both ovens are gas. Only the bottom one has convection. The top one is much smaller and only bake and broil. Bottom one is much larger with all the features\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 1)Do both ovens have rollers on the racks 2)Do both ovens broil 3)No keep warm, but you can get the same effect b\/c of the manual knob?\n Answer:","completion":" Only the lower oven has rollers. I don't know if the top oven does broil but the bottom does.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: i bought this range for my daughter. It burns food close to the sides of the oven when she uses the upper oven. Is there a way to correct this?\n Answer:","completion":" I have the same oven. There is a way to adjust the temperature. You will need an oven thermometer. I put one in the oven and turned it on to 200, then checked the temperature. If correct, turn up to 350 then check. Keep raising temperature to check it at all degrees. In the manual, it tells you step by step how to adjust the temperature control behind the knob. Try that to see if what the knob is set to is actually the temperature inside the oven. It may need to be adjusted, hope this helps !\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a down draft stove?\n Answer:","completion":" No it is not. The vents in the back are to vent the stoves. It is not down draft.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Some dual fuel top burners will not light during a power outage due to a built in safety feature.

Otherwise during a power outage burners will light with a match. Ovens will not. (Only if lockout is not enabled before pier outage).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the fan really noisy? I was set on buying this but read the reviews about the fan being really noisy. We have an open kitchen\/living\/family\n Answer:","completion":" If the fan to which you refer is the convection oven fan, the answer is no, it is not noisy. The unit appears to be well insulated from sound.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it require venting to the outside?\n Answer:","completion":" No. However if you don't have any kind of ventilation (recirculating or outside) if you cook smokey\/smelly things your house will get smokey and smell. That is true of any range.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: LP gas users (Propane users) how would you rate the output of the burners? Who did your conversion to propane?\n Answer:","completion":" The burner output is great. To be honest, I do 90 % of my coming on the front right. This one has a range from fast boil to simmer with a small center burner. This is a stove you will enjoy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My shingles overlap\/overhan the back of the gutter. The shingles are heavy and can't be lifted to slip anything underneath. Will thiis work?\n Answer:","completion":" you will have to lift up the shingles in order to insert the back of thescreen.I just installed several of these on my house. And I found that in some places it took a fair amount of effort to push screen in under the shingles.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My gutters turn down on the inside of the gutter at a right angle for about 3\/8 to 1\/2 inch. Will your #854054 clip on to this type gutter?\n Answer:","completion":" It should fit, my gutters are simply the standard aluminum gutter available at home depot. The leafOut Micro Mesh Gutter Guard should fit. You can get a sample section of leafOut (small section about 12 inches long), think I got the sample from Amazon. The gutter guard is fantastic, I have maple trees and each spring the maple trees have little flying seedlings that fly everywhere, clogging the downspouts and germinating in the downspouts. A super clog that must be cleared with a pole.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does using these gutter guards void the roof warranty?\n Answer:","completion":" You should discuss this with your roofer to be certain, but it would be VERY surprising if it did.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone tried fitting this product with heating cables to help prevent ice dams? Which cables work and how difficult was the adaptation?\n Answer:","completion":" Heating cable for this gutter LeafsOut protector probably would not be satisfactory unless the cable ran the full length of the gutter to downspout. Electrical energy consumed by the heating cable would be cost prohibitive.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are ice dams more likely to occur when using gutter guards?\n Answer:","completion":" I added gutter guards when I had a new roof put on 6 months ago. I don't have a good answer to your question. However, I didn't notice any particular difference this winter.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Why can't I smell the fabric softener after the wash is done?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know. Of all the issues I had with this machine this isn't one I remember having to deal with.

{"prompt":"Question: I got my Whirpool Cabrio in 2006, it's still working great but is rusting on the inside rim and I'm wondering why?\n Answer:","completion":" I always left mine open to air it out until it was completely dry, only because it gets a funny smell. If it's rusting, to me that's a sign of it's not drying completely. I don't have any idea how you can get that rust off. I will never buy a Whirlpool washer or dryer again. I now have the GE front loaders and I love them! The washer has a rubber seal and after I'm finished washing for the day I do dry it with a towel. I, also, dry the inside window, then leave the door cracked open to make sure everything on the inside dries completely. Sorry about your rust problem and hope you can remedy that.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Should the switch be turn to on or off for it to be used as a timer? Either mine isn't working or I don't know what I am doing...\n Answer:","completion":" Huh? This apparatus is used to turn things on and off so you don't have to manually do it yourself. I have my turtles basking light plugged into it so the light turns on in the morning and off at night without me ever having to touch it.

{"prompt":"Question: How much power does the timer itself consume?\n Answer:","completion":" These timers have a geared one RPM\/day motor so in reality bare timer power consumption can be ~ 0.1 Amp (100mA) negligible compared to the 15 Amp tolerance. Be careful not to use ANY timer in an enclosed location where you store gasoline, paints or other flammables. The contacts arc (spark) and that works like a spark plug to ignite (explode vapors).

{"prompt":"Question: What type of leads come with the unit, i. e. alligator\/pin probe?\n Answer:","completion":" The unit has an alligator clip on each lead. This is a great little piece of test equipment. I was checking the caps in my old HP 1710A O-scope and it found three bad ones. When I unsoldered the cans from the circuit board I could see where the electrolite was pushing out of each one. I really like this thing. Highly recommend it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I work on old Amps, can it test 350 volt &amp; 450 volt capacitors.this question is pertaining to the Atlas ESR 70\n Answer:","completion":" While I'm not familiar with the failure modes of a capacitor, it measures the capacitance and equivalent series resistance (ESR) for any voltage level capacitor. I've replaced capacitors in spite of it's reading within factory specifications because I was concerned that the ESR 70 unit wasn't operating at the higher voltage level. The capacitor was not the problem and I should have trusted the unit.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Faucet attachment giving me problems. The water coming from faucet when not connected to d\/w is highly pressurized. Is this normal?\n Answer:","completion":" In a word, yes. But if you're interested in the why\/how, one may consider this: standard kitchen and bathroom faucets have a device located where the water exits, called an \"aerator\", which is usually comprised of a piece of steel screen, and a couple of metal or plastic components inside. This little gadget screws into the end of the faucet, precisely where you installed the adapter for the dishwasher. The purpose of this device is to intermix the exiting water with lots of air in order to increase the volume of the liquid by generating lots of little bubbles. This is why the water coming out of most faucets appears to be white and bubbly, instead of a steady, clear, stream like you would expect to see from the end of your garden hose. A faucet with an aerator produces a more controlled and gentle stream, and because the device mixes in lots of air, less water is needed in order to produce a steady and useful flow. In other words, aerators have the cumulative effect of drastically reducing both the volume of water and the exit speed of the water at the faucet. If you have noticed a difference in water pressure after installing the adapter for this dishwasher, I would venture to guess that you had one of these devices installed (99.9% of faucets do have one) and that you removed it in order to install the dishwasher adapter. So in summation, the good news is that if all my assumptions about your circumstance so far are correct, what you're experiencing is normal. The bad news (if it can be called bad?) is that you have to put up with a slightly more powerful, less ruley, stream of water coming out of your faucet. In that sense, it does represent a trade-off of sorts, however, it should also be pointed out that many people remove the aerators from the kitchen faucet on purpose, for the express purpose of achieving the higher pressure and flow that you're experiencing. Attempting to install the dishwasher adapter to the end of the aerator will not work because the dishwasher adapter will prevent any air from being drawn in to the aerator. If your faucet pressure is so high that it is a problem to use, the best advice would be to adjust the valves under your sink until you attain a more desirable rate of flow. I hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I fit a large pot or pan in this? And would it clean it good? It's alright if I have to put the pot or pan in alone for the wash.\n Answer:","completion":" Like all dishwashers it does have a pan size limit...for example: even when I had a full size maytag it would not hold my lobster pot. Nor would it clean something baked on completely. That said I am able to fit my 5qt dutch oven in it as well as (but not at the same time) my 6qt stock pot. Also it washes my 9x13 pyrex baking dish beautifully. The cleaning power is more about the detergent and how the items are arranged than about the dishwasher itself.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the dishwasher come with a warranty separate of the warranty you can purchase at checkout?\n Answer:","completion":" I never got the choice at check out. But I really don't recommend buying this. Mine broke a week after the 3 month warranty ran out. I called customer service and they did nothing to help. It's not worth it. Go with an actual brand and service protection. May be more expensive but it's worth it in the end.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want this unit but I need the connectors to run about a foot longer. Has anyone hacked into the the lines to extend them? Do tell!\n Answer:","completion":" We purchased this dishwasher about a year ago and the lines that came with it to connect to the sink were horrible and ugly! My husband is very familiar with plumbing so he was able to buy a few extra parts and hook up to the sink line which worked perfectly. It is now in a cabinet out of sight! I do not know what exactly he purchased, but I can ask him and get back to you, if you'd like?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Being this is portable does it have a hookup that hooks up directly to the water faucet?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a similar one from 2008 and it does. I recall having to get a small adapter for my faucet at a hardware store though. My machine has been working perfectly for almost 5 years now and never disappointed me. Totally recommend it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you hook it in perminantly?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you can hook it permanently. I bought it to use it on my RV and it is going to be installed like a regular dishwasher.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many dishes actually fit in? We are a two person household, how often should I expect to run it?\n Answer:","completion":" We are two in here also and I use it everyday, once a day (when we are out working, on weekdays, I use it every other day). It fits 6 dishes and I have tried to put a pan in it but it didn't get cleaned. Careful not to stuff it otherwise nothing will be cleaned, including your forks and knives.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many dishes actually fit in? We are a two person household, how often should I expect to run it?\n Answer:","completion":" It depends on your dishes, I run mine twice a week. Once on my big cooking day and then again at the end of the week. I live alone. The last day is mainly cups...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do I need an adapter for the faucet hookup?\n Answer:","completion":" The adapter that came with the dishwasher worked for us, it fit on the regular faucet after the screen fitting was removed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the 3 in 1 setting on the machine? I just purchased this and can't find what it specifically does\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not quite sure either, but my best guess is that it accomodates the 3-in-1 cleaning packets that are sold. Like the cascade ones with the triple cleaning power. I looked through the manual for an answer and came up short, but I've been using that setting with the packets and everything works well...\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: If I purchase the carbon filter with the hood does this need to be vented to outside?\n Answer:","completion":" No. The carbon filter is needed only if you vent inside.

{"prompt":"Question: My new amana fills but will not go to wash cycle???\n Answer:","completion":" Call amana and get it fixed under warranty. When the warranty runs out scrap it and get one from a different company. Mine has been repaired three times under warranty. Next time it breaks I'm buying a different washer from a different company. This machine was junk from the factory.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you know about the Kenmore 3.4 cu. ft. top load washer 20022?\n Answer:","completion":" I have the Amana washer, and I've had it for a bit over a year. It has worked very well for me. I found out it pretty much locks up as soon as you push the start button, ergo everything needs to be in before you push the button to start. Beyond that it works great, very reliable. The top comes off the spinner to put in fabric softner. That's about it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have the worst sewer smell coming from this machine. What gives?\n Answer:","completion":" Probably because this washing machine is a piece of crap...sorry I don't know what it is, but it doesn't really wash my clothes, so the smell is probably just buildup from all of the dirty clothing. Maybe try running an empty cycle to clear it out?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you open the top when you have no power?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't. The lid-lock mechanism in this unit is easy to break, and costs over $100 for just the replacement part.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how can you stop the washer from draining out when you want to add an item?\n Answer:","completion":" First thing I'd try to end the siphoning is to elevate the washer's drain hose. If the washer's drain hose is shoved deep into your home drain pipe, pull most of the drain hose out of the drain pipe and anchor it in that position. The added height should correct the problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have the top load but it has a lock when it starts. How can you get the lock to disengage to put fabric softener in the rinse cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" Hold the lock button down for 3 seconds. You will hear a click and the lock will come off and the cycle it is in will pause.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you wash a comforter in it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I washed a king size comforter in it today. I did have to adjust the water level so that the extra large water level goes to the top perforation drain hole. This is an easy thing to do. There are videos online that explain how to do it. It took me 2 minutes. Although it is supposed to be a 3.3 cubic foot drum I think there is actually more space than traditional washers. This agitator is smaller and takes up less space.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is difference between speedqueen AWN542 and AWN542S?\n Answer:","completion":" According to Speed Queen, they are the same model. The exact model number is actually Sp111t......etc so sometimes the S is there and sometimes it is not.\n"}

All I can tell you is the Speed Queen is the most awesome washer and dryer we have EVER owned. Not just because it is made in USA, but because it actually WASHES clothes in a reasonable amount of time without alot of noise. These new machines from other manufacturers are total junk. Enough said!\n"}

I don't care if the wine part goes over the sink. The legs must fit on the counter!\n Answer:","completion":" The legs on the one I have are 13 inches wide by 19.5 inches long. I quit using it because it is much too hard to clean- mold grows in the under part and the rack rusts though it is supposed to be stainless steel.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: if I buy any of the simplehuman products off Amazon, do they still have their 5 year manufacturer's warranty?\n Answer:","completion":" The manufacturer warranty would still apply.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this stainless steel? Does it rust?\n Answer:","completion":" I've had it in action for nearly two years (have long since thrown the box out, so don't know what the metal is), but it has not rusted one bit, and I really like it. The large size was a plus for me. The outside is metal. The bottom and drain train are gray plastic. I would say it's held up very well so far. Some have complained about spots on the bottom over time, but you just have to get it a wash once in a while, and they're gone.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there an easy way to clean it?\n Answer:","completion":" It comes apart for cleaning. I clean mine once a month...I've had it 2.5 months. I tak e all the parts off and the bottom rack out. I then just clean everything with sponge and dish liquid. I clean the inside of the rack where it sits at the side of the sink. I scrub and then tilt toward sink and use my sink sprayer to rinse. I do this with the bottom drainer tray back on the unit (after its been cleaned). That way all the water drains right out to the spout and into the sink as I spray. One area I can't get too is where the draining spout connects to the drain tray. Looks like it will get build up over time. I suspect I'll have to soak it or maybe put in dishwasher. Some of the pieces are dishwasher safe. I'm just not sure which ones but think it says on box. I have to check.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the direction of the water spout adjustable or is it only out of the wider side?\n Answer:","completion":" The spout is adjustable. It can be made to run out of the end as well as the side.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are all the legs on this (height) adjustable? Just wanted to confirm before ordering since I have a considerable lip to my sink.\n Answer:","completion":" Well yes and no, it comes as you can see it on the picture and it also comes with four rubber pieces to put on each leg to lift it a bit to maximize the draining I guess. I just measured it and the lowest part below the drain (that black shoe horn that sticks out) comes to 3 cm in height. the four rubber pieces you can put on each legs lifts it about 2 cm...anyways just send me a message if you want more precise info :)\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the minimum diameter?\n Answer:","completion":" It will heat a very small diameter butter-melter-thinghy. No limit on how small you can go. You could put a 12 inch Cast Iron Fry Pan on it. but the size of the magnetic heating element under the glass is 7 inches in diameter so it only heats the center. Around the edge of the pan is not hot enough for max heat. A problem for saute, but not to boil water or slow cook, depends on what you're cooking. I use my 8 inch cast iron fry pan a lot. Our 4 qt capacity enameled cast iron Walmart LeCrueset knock-off works great as such bowl-shaped cookware has a smaller diameter area at the bottom. For serious cooking with a Wok you should use an extra large gas burner. Good quality Tri-clad cookware with the induction symbol stamped on the bottom such as Fagor cookware works very well and is not very expensive. I have a tall 8 1\/2\" diameter stockpot that holds 5-6 quarts that I use for soups, stews and slow cooking. The tri-clad bottom spreads the heat evenly, so thick stews don't burn on the low settings. Most six quart stainless steel Pressure cookers work OK, though you should only fill a P.C. 2\/3 full. My nephew uses it on his Cabin Cruiser because it doesn't draw too much current. Works fine cooking for 2-4 persons. W.O.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a 'warm' feature that will keep something at 100 degrees? I'd like to use this to melt butters waxes, then hold them, for soaping\n Answer:","completion":" There is no 'warm' setting. You'd have to use trial-and-error to find what settings (and pans) work for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone find that just 10 heat settings is too restrictive? Do you need more accurate variation in temperature control for cooking?\n Answer:","completion":" I am something of a gourmet cook, and have never felt that the number of settings was too limited. My only gripe, and it is minor, is that over time the lowest settings have become hotter. Used to be able to simmmer at 2, now simmers at one. Performance varies from pan to pan, and with some pans, 1 is almost too hot for a simmer. Over all, I am thrilled with the burner and recommend it highly.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is it recommended that for a 2-zone house (upstairs and downstairs) that you get two of these units?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not think so. This kit comes with the Main thermostat, 1 outdoor sensor and 1 Portable Comfort Control (PCC). The PCC can be moved around the house. In my case, I have a 2 story house and I keep the PCC in the second floor, at night when I am in the room I transfer the control from downstairs (main unit) to the PCC and the temperature in the room is kept at my preferred setting (Usually 78\/79). There is a drawback: The Main thermostast and the PCC cannot be used at the same time in tandem, so you are reading the temp either from the main or from the PCC but not both at the same time. For example if I set downstairs to be 80 and the PCC to be 79 the A\/C will not turn on to keep both settings, only to keep the one that at that moment is the master (either the main unit or the PCC). If you want to keep an average setting in your house, like having multiple sensors indoor and that the AC turns on to keep this average, then there are small indoor units (no screen) that are cheap that can be used for that.\n"}

I don't know what a \"Nest\" is. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it call out if temp drops below a set point (freeze alarm)?\n Answer:","completion":" I belive you need the Red Link Enabled Internet Gateway for this functionality. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Honeywell-THM6000R1002-Enabled-Internet-Gateway\/dp\/B006BD1K4A\/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1355862230&sr=8-2&keywords=YTHX9321R5061\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Anyway to muffle the \"clicking\" sound these make. We have 2 in our new house and one was installed in master bedroom and wakes us up\n Answer:","completion":" That's a good question for either the Honeywell customer support online or 800 support center. Although, any sound that you are unaccustomed to, will disturb a good nights sleep. My experience has been, after having the YTHX in place for over 3 months, that your rest cycle will be less interrupted with the more familiar sound. However if you are a very light sleeper more drastic measures might be considered, such as replacing the thermosat to a more remote location. Fishing wires thru walls and ceilings is a moderate (experience level) undertaking. I had to run a fifth wire (previous 4-wire would not support the YTHX), and am familiar with the undertaking. If not, an ac or electrician can easily handle the issue. Good Luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the unit also control a humidifier?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it controls humidity level in the house and can be set dynamically on touchscreen.\n"}

You MUST use a rubber type adhesive to keep it in the grate. If the one you have the ones with a dome type piece that extends out... these will not work.

{"prompt":"Question: I'd like to set this up with the back close to a wall. Can I fit 2 corny kegs and the CO2 bottle inside the unit so it will be more flush to the wall?\n Answer:","completion":" No. We have two, 5 gallon kegs in ours and it's a very tight squeeze. The co2 will have to be in the back. It's still a great kegerator though!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you install this under a counter\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, that's how mine is. Just need to drill hole in countertop. Granite installers did it and just used a lot of silicone to adhere to counter top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you install this under a counter\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, depending on your counter height. You will need to cut a hole in the counter to feed the facet tower through. This model isn't specifically designed to be an undercounter model; there are others that may be a better choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We prefer nitro poured beers rather than CO2. Is it possible to use nitro with this dispenser?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. You need to get a nitro spout a nitro canister and fill with beer gas.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Just bought the stainless version of this kegerator - what is the loose metal plate that came with it inside?\n Answer:","completion":" It goes on the bottom for the kegs to sit on. I recommend watching Edgestar's youtube videos about setup and maintenance. Very helpful--just search for edgestar kegerator.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my edgestar kegerator is making a loud popping noise about once every couple of hours\n Answer:","completion":" I have this and I hate the loud popping sound.

{"prompt":"Question: I have a dual tap edgestar. I think my boys are tapping off it when we go to bed is there a lock i can get for the taps or is turning off the co2 the\n Answer:","completion":" There are faucet locks available as others have said. Shutting off co2 won't stop the pressurized keg from releasing beer\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall is the tower (to know space needed under the counter)?Also, is there any reason the CO2 container can't go inside on the shelf?\n Answer:","completion":" The tower itself is about 12 inches. The height to the top of the handles is about 15.5 inches. I'm not sure what shelf you are referring to for the CO2. The kegs take up most of the inside. You may be able to squeeze it in there but there is a bracket on the back specificaly for the CO2. Hope this helps\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this double faucet unit have the ability to turn off one of the co2 lines--if I only wanted one keg at a time?\n Answer:","completion":" Not with the regulator that is supplied with the unit. The one that ships with this unit is a single valve regulator with a \"T\" connector for running CO2 to both the individual kegs\/lines. I upgraded the regulator when I bought this unit (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0060NOX40\/ref=oh_details_o05_s02_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and I am extremely pleased with it, as it lets me shut the CO2 to each keg as needed. If you plan on having more than a keg active at one time, I really feel that this saves CO2 and gives you the ability to pressurize each keg as you need to. You can find cheaper dual pressure regulators, but this one is quality.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a good serving pressure (psi) and how can i tell if the flow is right?\n Answer:","completion":" In general, most US produced ales and lagers should be dispensed at 10 to 12 PSI. Stout and other nitrogen reliant keg beers are usually dispensed at 25 to 30 PSI.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do i get beer for it coors light\n Answer:","completion":" Can't get 1\/6 kegs in my area and the full barrel coors won't fit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the connection to the keg work with a pin lock system? My Corney keg has pin lock set up.\n Answer:","completion":" The connection only comes setup for a Sanke connection. However, your beer shop will have the know how to inexpensively convert the connects to fit your system. I use 2 5 gallon ball lock corny kegs and the system works great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to attach these to the bottom of toy cars so they will stick to magnetic paint. What kind of adhesive would help stick these to the car? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" you could use gorilla glue or super glue. But these are so tiny, unless you took the wheels off of the cars they are not going to reach the paint. what I mean by that is the magnets will not go past the tires.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these magnets adhesive backed?\n Answer:","completion":" No they are not\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone let me know how much weight you would estimate they can hold? Also, how hard is it really to pull them off the fridge? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" 1 magnet can hold up to 2 letter sized (8.5x11) sheets of paper on my fridge. It also had no problem holding 1 letter sized (8.5x11) sheet of photo paper. I'm not sure why someone had to use 5 magnets to hold one 5x7 but perhaps it depends on your fridge. Mine's fairly glossy but the magnets seem to stick to it quite well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 4 magnets on each corner of a letter size paper attached to a fridge\/magnetic board. would it work?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. One magnet would probably work all by itself. I assume you mean ONE magnet on each corner for a total of four. They are really strong, so four would definitely be ok.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to magnetize the top and bottom of a ship rather than cementing, so I can see the interior at times then close it up for exterior display can it do this without breaking the model when prying open?\n Answer:","completion":" These magnets are tiny but they are also strong. Direct magnet to metal contact on a model would not be recommended as these magnets do have some power. However, if you were to apply a barrier between the magnet and the metal then it would probably be okay.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone tell me the N rating on these magnets?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not know for sure but found some on another website that say N52...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these come shipped in one tube? I'd like to gift to two people. Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Mine were shipped in a bag. I'm not sure if it's possible to divide it up into two packages of 25 unless you contact the seller.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I just bought this. How do you clean the cast iron grates? I was told (by mom) to never use water on cast iron.\n Answer:","completion":" We clean the the grates with a damp dish washing cloth. If it ever needed serious scrubbing, I would use a scouring pad sold for a barbeque grate and rinse with water. 'Mom' may have been worried about rust in a cast iron skillet or depleting the conditioning oil in the skillet. I sometimes use water in my cast iron skillet if it is seriously messy, but it rusts a bit if it is not dried out after cleaning. It takes a touch more oil to use the skillet the next time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the broiler on the top or the bottom of the oven?\n Answer:","completion":" The broiler is on the top of the oven.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How well does this wash eggs?\n Answer:","completion":" The shells comes out white and clean... With no yolk residue to be found.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall is this machine? Does it have several washing modes (i.e. normal, gentle)? Also how does it drain? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" Hi there ~ It's about a foot and a half high, it doesn't have a lot of \"modes\" but it's pretty gentle on clothes. You can't fit very much in it....a load of tshirts and underwear maybe. It drains through a hose that you aim into your sink. I always put mine on the kitchen counter next to the sink so that the hose from the kitchen faucet fills it up and another hose drains into into the sink. Simple and easy but for very small loads.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I wash a pair of jeans in the Eco Egg Washing Machine?\n Answer:","completion":" No not really. I found that it was ok for shirts or anything smaller. I still had to do a weekly pants\/jeans wash.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have a spin cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" No. it will drain out the water ,but u must wring out by hand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does it do washing cloth diapers?\n Answer:","completion":" If I were a mother again, I would have no problem buying this product for washing diapers. It has a limited capacity, but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry. For busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers. But that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week. I wouldn't mind at all. Cloth diapers are the healthiest. Babies do NOT need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables. I say that with a little authority. I used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company. Trust me. Cloth diapers are healthier than disposables. I would never let a disposable touch my baby if I didn't have to. As for the egg, you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it. Probably eight to twelve toddler diapers. I don't think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room. Otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom. The full wash is about thirty minutes. Wash and no rise is about fifteen. Just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet! I wish my mom had it in the 1950's and 1960's when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time. I was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet. Then put them in the bleach pail. I would have loved the ego egg. Just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg. Run it and then wring them out. Throw them in the dryer or hang them up. You don't have to mix them in with regular laundry and you can dry them together, fold them and put them away.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: After washing, there is still some water in the machine. How can I get rid of it completely? I tried to select cycle to drain.\n Answer:","completion":" I just turn the Egg upside down and pour it into the sink. The Egg is a little heavy but not too heavy to be able to do that easily enough.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is anyone else having trouble with the inlet hose popping off the faucet adaptor once you turn on the faucet due to the water flow?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, that happened to me a lot of times ... That means you are not doing it right. The secret its to heard like a click ... Then turned the water slowly to see if the hose won't come out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this use regular or HE (High Efficiency) detergent?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, its uses any detergent, including he\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: if my faucet doesn't fit, can i pour water directly on to the machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. That's how I use it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you wash with hot water? By hot meaning as hot as the faucet can provide, which in my case can be hot, but not burning hot. Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" The hose leaked (bad, sprayed) when I just used straight hot water (lucky I heard it)... When I mixed or just used cold water there was no problem. After the hot water incident I had no problems with the hose leaking...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the height with the casters on? I have exactly 34 inches of clearance where the washer is supposed to go.\n Answer:","completion":" The height is 33 1\/2\" with the door closed. If you open the door, it folds in half and the height would be 40\". With the door unfolded, it is 46 1\/2\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the clothes come out linty? I can't afford to buy a dryer yet.\n Answer:","completion":" No they don't come out linty at all! There is actually a lint filter in the agitator that catches the lint.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this portable washer come with casters, so it can be moved easily??\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does. I have mine attached to permanent hookups but I kept the accessories and checked out the casters. They are not swivel but rather unidirectional so you would want to make sure you keep the machine someplace where you don't have to turn a million corners to get it to the sink. I've also been meaning to edit my review to add a feature that wasn't listed in the manual: a fabric softener dispenser. It kind of hides on the lip of the drum but it's there. Just one more reason to really like this machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how much detergent do I use in the Danby 1.7 washer?\n Answer:","completion":" I use about half of what I would on a regular washing machine, not a extra large tub washer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how much clothes can you put in this washer\n Answer:","completion":" It all depends on what you're putting in the washer. As long as you don't exceed the load capacity of 11.02 lbs you should be OK. This washer works best when the clothes are loaded loosely in the machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am trying to decide between this model and the Haier HLP24E (the 1.5 cubic foot one). Has anyone owned both that can give a recommendation?\n Answer:","completion":" I had the Haier model for about six months before it stopped working for me. I replaced it with the Danby and have been using it for about a year. It handles a larger load, and the agitator does a much better job of cleaning than the pulse action on the Haier.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hello, We live in an apartment with the average kitchen sink. What sort of water hook-up is required? I assume the drain just vents into the sink.\n Answer:","completion":" We live in an apartment also, and Danby provides you with everything you need to hook it up to an average kitchen sink. They give you a fitting that mounts on your faucet, and a quick disconnect on the hose so you can get it off easily. It vents into the sink, but we have to be careful to weigh the hose down or the water pressure forces it right out of the sink.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many clothes can you stick in this washer\n Answer:","completion":" You can put about 3-6 shirts\/sweaters, depending on whether you're talking t-shirts or hooded sweatshirts, and then add some socks, washcloths, hand towels. Jeans\/pants - You could put 4 in, but sweatpants, I'd put 3, and again add some misc little stuff. With sheets - a fitted & flat queen sheet can go in together, but unfortunately sometimes it seems to cause one of them to somehow get caught over the center \"swish\" piece. So I typically wash one of them & add a bunch of other small stuff. Not for washing pillows or blankets - though you could toss a throw in. It does a good job, but the thing I hate most about it is if you keep it somewhere when not in use & then wheel it to a sink to hook up to water, the wheeling isn't the most smooth in the world. This is primarily related to the leveling knob on the side, which can pop out of the frame a lot. So if your load is imbalanced with a bigger item (if ya can fit it), that helps level it, but then is a pain in the neck. It cleans well, but it's definitely a moderate size closer to the small side than large. Hope that makes sense!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you hook this washer up to a kitchen sink? What kind of adapter is there to buy as some sites say threads are not long enough on faucet.\n Answer:","completion":" I had this hooked up to my kitchen sink but later moved into the bathroom and all the attachments needed came with the washer. It was easy to hook up, I don't recall any glitches at all. I have had this for more than a year, and I could not recommend this washer highly enough. It cleans my clothes so well, I'd been going to a laundromat for so long I almost forgot what really clean clothes smelled like. I have a couple friends who almost beg me to let them do laundry at my house because it cleans so much better than a coin operated machine. It is quiet, and doesn't seem to use much electricity.\n"}

Look carefully on bottoms of your bins. Some have imprinted parts numbers. Some don't. Hope you are lucky and yours do!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this work on model GLER341CC0 Frigidaire Dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it will work. Most units are standard until u get to the brand new models.

{"prompt":"Question: is this OK for outdoor use\n Answer:","completion":" I do not believe it is intended for that purpose, however if it were mounted in a weatherproof cabinet with properly protected electrical and plumbing you could probably get away with it.

I have my dishwasher plumbed into my fridge h20 line and waste line plumbed into under sink drain line. My unit is situated atop my fridge. I can easily remove the entire dish rack to load with ease.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have rubber feet on the bottom? The height will just barely fit under my cabinets (I think), and I want to be able to shave 1\/16\" off.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes mine does about 1\/4\". The cabinet itself is 17\" tall\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What about cups or other dishes that are dishwasher safe for top rack only? Has anyone tried washing them in this machine?\n Answer:","completion":" 'Top rack only' applies to dishwashers with a drying cycle heating coil, as the coil will melt or disfigure those items. This dishwasher doesn't have a heating coil. Instead it dries items by heating up the water to around 160 degrees while rinsing so everything gets really hot; then drains the water; then the items (mostly) evaporate the water off because they are so hot. Plastic-ware will not melt at this temperature so your 'top rack' items can be put in there like all other items.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this machine be attached to a garden hose?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much does it weigh?\n Answer:","completion":" The box weighed about 50 pounds when the unit was delivered. If I subtract the weight of the packaging, my best estimate is the dishwasher weighs between 42 and 45 pounds.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is washer only washer for a few seconds\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure mine works great is the water connected and flowing to the unit? Try changing the selector knob and trying it again good luck\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is the koldfront dishwasher made?\n Answer:","completion":" Made in China, according to the specs sticker on the back of my unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does it take to run a load of dishes?\n Answer:","completion":" This is all according to the manual: The heaviest mode is 100 minutes (1:40), the normal mode, which is what I run on, is 85 minutes, just under an hour and a half. Light is 75 minutes. Glassware mode is 70, and speed mode, which does not dry, is 45 minutes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The faucet adapter does not fit. Anyone know how I'm supposed to know what size I should get? Nowhere in the manual does it say what size this one is.\n Answer:","completion":" I struggled with this too until I realized the adapter is in the nozzle attachment.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it possible to install the water and waste lines directly under the sink\n Answer:","completion":" That's how I hooked ours up, I drilled a hole through the countertop behind the unit, underneath spliced into hot water line and the sink drain. Works perfect.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are you supposed to leave the water running the entire cycle or is there a point where you turn it off? If not this might run up my water bill :\/\n Answer:","completion":" Yes...However, it really doesn't use alot of water. Although the faucet is turned on the entire time, the dishwasher only pulls water from it at certain times. So the water is not running into the dishwasher the whole time. ...Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you hook these portable dishwasher up and how do they drain?\n Answer:","completion":" There is a hose (it's actually 2 in 1) coming from the back of the unit that attaches to your faucet. The faucet remains on throughout the cycle and the unit controls the flow of water. From that same hose it drains into the sink. The hose isn't very long so you will want to make sure you have space and an outlet within a few feet of the sink.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is the DRAIN hose? My cabinets are too low to place the item right next to my sink.\n Answer:","completion":" Approximately 5 feet also note that the supply and drain hose are connected together on the sink adapter and are attached on the back of the unit looking from the front on the right side. So if placed to left of sink you would have full length of hose if placed to right about 3 feet. Hope this helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you wash cups or other dishes that are dishwasher safe for top rack only? Has anyone tried washing them in this machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It cleans everything that goes in a normal dishwasher. It also has a setting for light\/china, and soak.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long are the wash setting times?\n Answer:","completion":" The one we typically use is about an hour and a half (includes heated drying time).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it use the same amount of dish detergent as the largerdishwashers? Can you use the dish detergent pods?\n Answer:","completion":" I would have to say it uses about as much as a larger dishwasher. I think that the pods would probably work if their liquid pods The pods that get hard might not work in there\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does my dishwasher leak from underneath? Can I fix it myself or do I have to return it?\n Answer:","completion":" If u are using rinse aid, stop using and run couple of cycles without. Rinse aid causes these dishwashers to have too many suds when mixed with the detergent, thereby causing leaks. Those dishwasher tablets work best for these small washers. The tabs contain a small oamount of Rinse aid. Whenever I fill the built-in reservoir with Rinse Aid mine too oozes out. Once I stopped using rinse aid, the issue stopped. Try that if it still leaks then return, try running and dont add soap until the rinse aid dissappears. Then use tabs once Rinse Aid is gone, this works for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it suitable for a family of 5?\n Answer:","completion":" It works great for just the two of us. I don't think it's heavy duty enough for a family of five. You would have to run it constantly for that many dishes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I see more pictures?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, we have 5 other pictures which are not currently being displayed, these should be uploaded shortly.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this good to replace valve #W10408179 for an Estate TS25AFXKQ03? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Dean, It appeared to me that it was kind of a fit-all type that one side takes care of the ice-maker and the other takes care of the water dispenser. Most of the stuff that came with it to install I didn't use but I will say it was the second one (the first one lasted about two years) I've replaced. Good thing is that they're not expensive. So far with this one...so good....\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can I use cast iron fry pan 11 inches for my nesco induction cooktop 1500 watts\n Answer:","completion":" Cast iron is not an issue, but I found that size is. Larger size pots make the unit heat up and trigger an automatic shut off. The manual that came with it reads \"Use cookware that is flat, suitable for induction heating and having a bottom diameter between 3.15 inches and 10.00 inches.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the largest quart pot can you use\n Answer:","completion":" The induction surface is 10 inches in diameter. Any pot that has a bottom that size or less will work. Our stock pot is 8 quarts and it works very well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it cool to the touch with your hand when it's on? I saw something like that on tv. Is this the same type of item?\n Answer:","completion":" It is cool. But it will not turn on until it senses iron, steel. It will not turn on with copper, aluminum, glass, ceramic, and some stainless. When it senses the right magnetic material, it induces magnetic energy into the metal. When it does that the surface of the PIC does not get hot on it's own. The cookware gets hot very fast! When the cookware gets hot it will transfer heat to the surface of the PIC. This model has only 5 heat settings. I am completely satisfied. The units on TV are more sophisticated and more expensive. This Nesco is 1500 watts. I have tested this Nesco and it does not proportion the energy at its lower settings (like a microwave in defrost mode). Some do and can cause burning. Some more expensive I have seen are 1800 watts. This Nesco is a practical start to get to know what induction cooking is about. Experiment with what kinds of cookware is right for you. At a later time you can add another one or two. This could be the next cooking revolution since the microwave. Have fun exploring and cooking.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hello Nesco users...has anyone used the other ever popular NuWave Induction seen on TV to compare with Nesco,.there's quite diff in price? thank you\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I have 2 NuWave Pic 14 and love them! I've had them for a few months and I believe they are the Cadillac of induction cooking. They have 6 levels of cooking with up and down buttons for 5 degree increments of precise cooking. For example, the med. high button shows 375 degree temp. but you can change that to any temp. you want by simply pushing the up, down button. I've only had the Nesco less than a week. I purchased it for when I cook for special occasions, but find I have cooked with it every day. Both are very good cooktops, one has all the bells and whistles and the other cooks just as well. By the way, the NuWaves cost me right under $210.00 delivered.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this cooktop truly portable, as in taking it camping or on a picnic where there are no outlets to plug in appliances?\n Answer:","completion":" This cooktop is an electric appliance and doesn't work unless it is plugged into an electric outlet. It is portable because it is small enough to carry from place to place.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it work with 220 and 120 ?\n Answer:","completion":" The \"name plate\" on the bottom specifies 1500W at 120 volts. In my opinion it will be destroyed at 220 volts as well as attempting to operate it on direct current. AC only. hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you recharge this by plugging into a car?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought one for a series 60. It came with a cord to use with charging it from a car battery, as well as detailed instructions for doing so. However, I'm planning to charge mine just from the wall outlets at home before a trip since I'm unlikely to need it for more that two days. I use the lowest pressure setting--4.0--and it ran for two nights on the battery with the humidifier without running out of power. However, I understand that the battery lasts for shorter periods as the pressure setting increases, and for some people this means humidifier use isn't possible.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with a REMstar plus with c-flex CPA\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the CPAP Battery Pack will work with a REMstar Plus as long as it is not the latest \"60 Series\" unit. To check if your REMstar Plus is a \"60 Series\" machine look at the bottom of the CPAP and see if you find the numbers 260P or DS260 or something similar. The number \"60\" indicates the unit is from the 60 Series which requires a different power cord than the one supplied with this battery pack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know what the Watt Hours would be for this battery?\n Answer:","completion":" This CPAP battery is rated at 100Wh.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will I need a inverter\/converter to use with my 50 series Medtronic bipap?\n Answer:","completion":" No idea since I don't use that model. You'll want to consult the manual for either your bipap or the battery. You can probably google and find them both. I can tell you that I didn't need anything extra for my Respironics.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would this battery work for a devilbliss unit?\n Answer:","completion":" It would run it, it's just unknown how long it would last. Check out the times of operation On the web sight for Respironics for various Capp machines. You'll have to figure the load.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it work with the S9?\n Answer:","completion":" You can buy an inexpensive generic DC to AC adapter that will allow you to plug any CPAP device into it . Once you do that, you can think of it as a battery powered wall outlet.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: A few reviews said the taste was not good. Your Answer?\n Answer:","completion":" The taste with the Swift replacement was worse than no filter.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the installed depth of this machine? Is it really just 29.75\", or do I need to allot more space to install this washer?\n Answer:","completion":" No the installation depth is 30.25\" The measurement around the base where it touches the floor is what is listed with the machines. They don't measure the circumference of the machine at the middle with the doors and stuff that sticks out for installation is the back we measured 30.25\". Plus you need to take into account the door must stand open at least an hour after use for proper drying to prevent mold in the machine. I love my machine but the fit is tight and the door being open in to our hallway can be a problem. I've learned something else the LG needs to be drained at least once every few weeks depending on use. There is an additional drain in the machine that collects the little trickle of water wrung out in the spin cycle. This drain is very difficult to use if the machine is setting on the floor. I would recommend buying the storage drawers that the machine set on if you are not stacking this on a dryer. Go for it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this 110 or 220 volt machine?\n Answer:","completion":" This one is 110V But I'm sure you can request a 220v if you wish as I'm told its cheaper on your bill\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Where do I find spin only cycle on LG steam 11kg washing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" with the machine on, but no cycle selected try pressing the spin button. On mine that sets up 14 mins of spin. You can then choose how hard to spin and hit start.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is a normal wash cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" normal wash is 49 minutes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there a matching dryer for this washer\n Answer:","completion":" I believe there is (although I didn't need a new dryer). LG's washing machines seem to start with WM, and their dryers start with DLE. So DLE2650 would be the mate to this washing machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can someone clarify which symbols go with which wash cycle? the manuak seriously needs a rewrite.\n Answer:","completion":" My manual was clear: 12 o'clock position, INTENSIVE (STRONG). 2 o'clock, NORMAL. 4 o'clock, ECONOMY. 6 o'clock, RINSE. 8 o'clock, RAPID WASH. 10 o'clock, SOAK.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this machine come with everything needed to hook up to the water source?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, hose which is stored in back nicely when not in use. an adapter for your faucet although I had to buy a second rubber washer so that it didn't leak when the dw was on. It also comes with a white funnel for the salt aid. In my long review I had said the salt aid light stayed on even after I used the machine, but it has since turned off... maybe it just needed time to 'soak in' but it works well now. Plug is long, also stored in back. The only thing you really need to buy is dishwasher detergent and a rinse aid (I use Jetdry) for the slots inside, and the salt aid which is put through the funnel on the inside. Found it hard to find, $25 some places but finally found 2 pound bag for $8 on amazon by whirlpool. Says it can take up to four pounds but I just used the 2 to see if it worked. So far so good. very happy with it, very very quiet, easy to roll around.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the shipping package say what is in the box? Or is it a nondescript Amazon box?\n Answer:","completion":" It comes in a Danby box with a picture of the appliance on the outside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Some water has collected in the bottom of the dishwasher. How can I drain that water before carrying it downstairs?\n Answer:","completion":" The easiest way is to turn on the dishwasher and start a cycle which will let the water out before it starts a new cycle, then turn it off. According to the manual, a small amount of water collecting at the bottom of the dishwasher is normal, but if it seems like too much, this would probably be the best way. The other way might be to remove the lower shelf and let a towel sop it up, but my first recommendation would likely be simpler.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I know if my faucet is compatible with the unit? I live in an apartment where I cannot replace the faucet.\n Answer:","completion":" If you have a standard faucet with an aerator that unscrews or a faucet with screw threads on it. What does not work is the faucet head that pulls out and becomes a sprayer. If you have a doubt you can order a faucet adapter for $7.99. Just type \"Danby faucet adaptor\" in Amazon search.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be installed easily or do I need to call a plumber?\n Answer:","completion":" No need to call a plumber- you just hook it up (easily) to your faucet when you want to use it, and then unhook it when it's done.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is the hose connecting this to the sink\/how far from the sink can the dishwasher be?\n Answer:","completion":" The hose is pretty short ( about 3-4 ft) but is easy to detach and reattach to move. It's on wheels and moving it is simple. Mine has to sit directly in front of the sink. You can also buy longer hoses for it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Need quick response! If the hose doesn't reach is their a way to expand it??? TIA!\n Answer:","completion":" Not that I know of. We have to wheel our washer pretty close to the sink, I wish the hose was a bit longer too.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there a gentle cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" I copied and pasted the section from the operators manual that describes each wash setting. Hope this will help. The setting on the machine that has the stemware symbol corresponds to Rapid Wash in the Operators Manual. A bit confusing perhaps. I routinely put items in my Danby that friends with full size dishwashers are afraid to put in theirs, and I've never had any issues. I think the key for delicate items is loading the dishwasher so dishes can't bang around RAPID WASH Glassware: For lightly soiled loads, such as glasses, crystal and fine china\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it possible to take the wheels off? if so how high is it without wheels?\n Answer:","completion":" I suppose you could remove the wheels, but then it would be 2-3 inches lower than a standard countertop. The hose is only about 3' long and must drain into the sink or a pipe, with the faucet directly above it. It only fits over a typical kitchen or bathroom style faucet, not a threaded one like for washing machines. They do make a version for permanent installation. I recommend buying from Walmart in case you need to return it for any reason.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Millers rubberized 7.5gal. keg. Will it fit?\n Answer:","completion":" It should fit if you use the round keg shelf that came with the kegerator. I use 1\/4 kegs in mine and with the shelf they fit perfect.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a extension piece that I can get to raise the tape head base off the fridge? (so I can mount the tap head base on a counter top)\n Answer:","completion":" You might be careful with that. This cooler needs fresh air and not enclosed within a cabinet. You will also require some kind of blower to keep the beer line cold on your extension, otherwise your first couple of beers after it sits will be primarely foam.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this unit be converted to dispense wine and how to convert?\n Answer:","completion":" I DID NOT BUY THIS UNIT\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be installed under-counter and does it cool properly if installed under-counter?\n Answer:","completion":" I installed this under an outdoor kitchen outside in Jacksonville Florida did not receive any complaints so it must be working well\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How cold does this get? I need close to 34*F\n Answer:","completion":" You can get it below freezing if you want. There is no temperature gauge, so you need to put a thermometer inside and inside and play with it a little, but it will get as cold as you want.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the actual height of the fridge unit (minus the rack and the wheel space)\n Answer:","completion":" Will get back to u on this one\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the steel rack be taken off and the tower removed and mounted on top of an outdoor counter. I realize I will have to insulate the hole in the top\n Answer:","completion":" My Son-in law did that and it works fine. The distance (tubing) to the tap need to be short to keep it cool.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Good morning, if i buy the Keg Cooler , do i need any aditional accesory so i can use it, thank you\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with a CO2 tank but it will need to be filled with CO2. Also another good thing to get but not necessary is a kegerator cleaning kit. Other than that your good to go!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would two 1\/6 kegs fit in here? I know I would have to buy a dual tap.\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the CO2 tank fit in the kegerator with a 1\/2 barrel keg (15.5 gal)?\n Answer:","completion":" The tank sits outside of the kegerator, so you can hook up any size tank you'd like, The line runs through and air tight hole out of the back. There's a tank holder that attaches to the back, but i think it only holds up to a 5gal tank.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: you show a cooktop, but it says its a cover. what is it for $63.00?\n Answer:","completion":" I ordered this thinking it was a cooktop, but its just a cover for it! I sent it back. I found a black stove with the cover on another site, can't remember or I would share.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the drop in unit and the cook top for this price?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Only a flat cover.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come in white?\n Answer:","completion":" The covers for the two burner pictured are onlyoffered in the stainless steel.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a complete operating cook top unit. An earlier question states it is only the stainless cover. If the unit is complete, what are the drop in dimensions? Thanks - Greg\n Answer:","completion":" Suburban 2-burner drop in dimensions: 11 5\/8\" wide x 16 3\/8\" length x 3 1\/8\" deep Suburban 3-burner drop in dimensions: 16 1\/8\" wide x 18 15\/16\" length x 3 1\/8\" deep\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Please provide me with dimensions of this cooktop cover. Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" First, this is just a cover, not a cook top. The dimensions are 13 7\/8 by 18 1\/4 inches. When I first ordered this I thought I was ordering the cook top. I ended up getting the cool top that matched.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it quiet?\n Answer:","completion":" As compared to others yes, but any fan creates sound when moving air through the filters. All in all very satisfied with performance of this product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This fan mentions that is adjustable for height. Can you slide this up when not need and then back down when desired?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it is adjustable during installation only to get you proper height from the fan to the stove top for proper draft.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this come with a cap for when the duct comes though the outside wall?\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this company, EUREKA, related the vacuum cleaner maker?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know but I will tell you that the quality of this hood is great, we have had it installed for quite awhile and not a single problem.I would highly recommend this hood.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the 30\" range hood OK for a 30\" gas range, or is it recommended that the hood be wider than the range? (i.e. a 36\" hood?)\n Answer:","completion":" I think a 30 over 30 is fine. I've been renovation homes for 15 years and see no problem with that. Coincidentally though just last night I noticed the plastic tabs to remove the two screens have melted. This could be because I installed the hood over a commercial grade range in my home. I don't know, but I'll need to now have those parts replaced. The fan is quiet and that's a plus.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a 7ft 8in ceiling. Will this range hood work for that? Also, we don't want the hood the hand more than 24 inches from the ceiling.\n Answer:","completion":" my ceiling is only 8 ft and the hood works fine. There is a standard height above the oven that is a code. I am not sure of the exact distance, but I know my setting on the fan meets that code. The fan adjusts with two stainless steel sleeves that allow you to set the distance within a range. Again, I do not have those measurements in front of me, but this fans works in a kitchen with an 8 ft ceiling. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is db level?\n Answer:","completion":" Decibel level, it's the amount of noise the fan creates while running. I have this particular fan and it isn't very loud on low or medium but while on high it can be noisy. I'm ok with this though because you will be hard pressed to find a 900 cfm fan that isn't, especially for this price.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the minimum length you can make this chimney? I need it to be no longer than 26\"\n Answer:","completion":" Just measured; 24\" would be the absolute minimum. As to the unit, I would highly recomend this as a quiet, efficient, good looking unit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this unit for ductless ventilation.\n Answer:","completion":" Very happy with this product. My is vented thru the roof. I strongly suggest this setup\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is an extension available for a 10' ceiling? If so, how much?\n Answer:","completion":" I dont think so. At full extension mine only reaches 45 -50 down from the roof\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why will it not fill with water? I checked all ie codes and can not find the problem\n Answer:","completion":" Some where in the manual it will tell you not to expect the washer to fill with water. I know exactly what you are talking about. I was wondering about the water level when we got ours, but I found the answer in the book. These machine are built to use very little water. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What year was this product manufactured?\n Answer:","completion":" 2012\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: LGWM3470HWA - Has anyone had problems with the gray &amp; red lettering wearing off front panel of washer &amp; dryer? I've had 6 panel replacements.\n Answer:","completion":" oh yes! the letters wear off very quickly. although i only got one replacement out of LG. the technician blames the user. but i have other household appliances which are decades old and the lettering is still clean and crisp as day one. the silver decalling has also oxidized very quickly. i have relatives with LG machines with the same issues.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this part work for a Frigidaire washer Model# FCCW3000FS ?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello Nora: I purchased this product a month ago and would NOT recommend anyone else purchase it. First, it does not come with the coin reservoir in the photo (the steal bottom). Second, you would need a timer or way to tie into the power source. I had a professional electrician and he bought a specialist who works on slot machines in Las Vegas to try to install. They tell me it's impossible or would cost more to engineer than the washer is worth. I could not get any straight answers when I made the purchase if it would work on my machine, so I look at it as a $90 learning opportunity. I would recommend just buying a coin-operated washing machine. I have found Home Depot to have the best pricing available. Be careful when shopping online, I have found some \"great deals\" on coin op washer and dryers on websites like Best Buy, but when you read the fine print the machine does not come with the coin op shown in the photo.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be place on a ge coin operated electri dryer model DCCB330EJWC\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it can. That what I use it on\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this used to replace and existing coin-operated box or can it be installed to convert a non-coin-operated washer and\/or dryer? Big job doing so?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't believe it could convert a commercial washer into a coin-op\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it also contain a timer?\n Answer:","completion":" no it does not, it only top device to put coin in and coin collector on the bottom. I have to buy coin insert extra to collect all 8 coins it only comes with 4 coin insert.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: this have the timer inside and key\n Answer:","completion":" Yes I've purchased two others before. It comes with the keys and one timer, you can purchase other timers\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It this for the hole set up as show ?\n Answer:","completion":" you'll only get the coin slide, it's meant for replacements on existing coin op machines, not to convert.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Im from Costa Rica, I need 2 of those coin machines, But I need to know if this mechanism works with a special coin, or if only works with dollars?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi its not a coin machine like in picture.

{"prompt":"Question: We have the UE error (out of warranty) constantly - who is best to fix? Someone from LG?\n Answer:","completion":" Unfortunately, this is an inherent design flaw. There is no \"fix\", software updates often make it worse. There are a couple of work-arounds: For small loads (these make it go out of balance a lot) try \"baby wear\", otherwise the larger the load the less likely you will get UE code. Remember, if you see the Capital \"UE\" vs. the lower case ue, it means that the machine has filled with water and emptied several times trying to even out the load, wasted huge amounts of water, and then just shut off. I recommend giving to charity and taking a tax write off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: WATER LEAKS\n Answer:","completion":" We had a problem initially with water overflowing from the drain hose, but we extended the pipe with another pipe so it would extend deep into the drain pipe (6+ inches) and then clamped a rubber sleeve around the joined area. It works like a charm now.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is anyone having a problem with water temperature? Our machine only gets lukewarm even on the hot setting. Sensors replaced no help.\n Answer:","completion":" Is the hot water supply to the washer actually hot? Is there a long run of pipe to the water heater (water that has to be used up before the hot water appears)? Is the wash water hotter if you shut off the cold supply temporarily as a test? Do you have an on-demand water heater that maybe can't keep up? By the way, it seems like for the WARM water setting, this washer does not mix hot and cold to produce a specific target temperature. It just turns both on and you get what you get. It's up to you to adjust the valves of the supply (usually closing the cold valve slightly) to achieve the right temperature water for WARM.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: has anyone else had problems with the glass lid on the top loader\n Answer:","completion":" We have had this washer for the last two months and have had no issues with the glass lid. What kind of problems are you anticipating?\n"}

So if you are looking at the picture, you see the control panel above the door, from left to right is all plastic where all controls are. That is the only plastic on here.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are their problems with the rubber seal on the door having a strong order\n Answer:","completion":" The washer has a \"magnetic door plunger\" which holds the door ajar after finishing a wash cycle to allow air to circulate. The mildew problem some people face arises from not using this feature after each wash.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does it take to do a standard wash load?\n Answer:","completion":" i would not recommend any lg product because of the run around they gave me when the machine broke. but the normal wash with no added param is 53 min\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work in my Kenmore range model # 790.92609013 ?\n Answer:","completion":" It should work great.

The Cavaliere-Euro AP238-PS29-30 model claims 43dB to 68dB.\n Answer:","completion":" As a former Chief Engineer for the USN I became of DBs and the impact on hearing. We have had this Unit for over a month and even and 900 CFM the DB level is reasonable. At the lower settings, 1-4 it is quiet and below the average for a comparable Unit. I do recommend it.

{"prompt":"Question: This unit has a smoke sensor. How sensitive is it? How long does it take to activate the hood? Can it sense steam if you boil water?\n Answer:","completion":" I find it too sensitive and it would randomly come on so I dont use the auto setting. I also had to put a dot over the remote sensor as it was the same as the tv and everytime we turned on the tv the hood would come on. I do love it but one other thing is the.bulbs are not replacable and are not very bright. It is very efficient though and clears out smoke and steam quickly even on low speeds. Easy to clean also. .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it easy to install\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't call it easy, it take quite a bit of know how to run the vents, secure it to the cabinet, and cut the holes in the cabinets. It's also very heavy but the hood is well worth it. It works great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this available in a back vent instead of top vent exhaust?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello Arnie, Unfortunately we only have the exhaust vent coming out of the top and not out of the back of any of our models. Thank you, Range Hood Direct Buy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can I reduce the 8' VENT OUTLET To 5\" existing duct\n Answer:","completion":" If you can find an adapter, you can. It may not be a good idea to shrink the size of vent since this is a powerful vent and the matched vent pipe size will fully take its max vent function. 5\" vent size is kind of too small, but you can if you have no other choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I live in Atlanta. Who do you recommend to install? We need it to vent out and will have to punch through brick exterior walls.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, we are pretty happy with it.

{"prompt":"Question: How is this different from UL10-U30 model? All I want is a hood with real 900 CFM (or at least close to it). thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Based on my research before purchasing, the difference between these 2 units, per the XtremeAir website, is that the PX10-U30 features \"4-speed screen touch sensitive electronic control w\/ blue LED display; programmable 1-15 minute delayed power auto shut off; and remote control.\" The UL10-U30 has \"3-speed mechanical EZ push buttons\"; no touch display, no delayed auto shut off and no remote control. the PX also offers sensor operation, and I don't see that listed among the features of the UL. Bells and whistles in terms of the controls is the primary difference as far as I can tell. As to whether it's a \"true 900CFM\", I can't tell you for certain, but I can tell you that I've been extremely happy with the suction and smoke evacuation from this unit, not to mention the quietness. Installation was a bit of a bear, and definitely not one-man job. It's not overly \"complicated\", just that the unit is heavy and cumbersome and you definitely need to be methodical. But, if you take your time, go step-by-step (and have some help), I think you'll be as happy with the unit as I am. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone let me know how far the vent is located from the back? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" I can't really tell anymore because it's install and you can't see. If I had to guess, I would say about 2 or 3 inches. It is a great vent though.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this filter out chlorine and chloramine?\n Answer:","completion":" I based my selection of this filter on the lab report linked here \"http:\/\/crystalquest.com\/Water%20test%20Multi-Stage.pdf\" I am not a chemist and have not tested the water since attaching this filter to our ice maker. Understand that the report does not indicate from what model number the water was tested and that this test is from the Crystal Quest website. To be more specific as to answering your question---if chlorine is chloride \"http:\/\/www.nutriology.com\/chloride.php\" then, yes, it is filtered out but not 100%. As for chloramine \"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chloramine\"---the report lists different Dichlora*, Chlora* and Trichlora* compounds that are filtered out. On a personal level, the ice looks better and tastes better. I also noticed the cubes completely freeze now whereas, before the filter, the ice was not. I have not adjusted the freezer tempurature or ice timing.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: At what minimal height do we actually need to install this filter, to allow for clearance to change the cartridge?? We'd like it under the sink.\n Answer:","completion":" Fully assembled it is about 15 inches, you'll need another 10 inches to install the filter. I have mine installed as an external filter for the refrigerator water & ice, so I don't have a space issue. I measured under my sink and I have a good 25 inches in height on the inside. I'm sure if I had a drinking spout faucet I could install it under there without issue. Make sure you have a good 10 inches from the mounting surface to allow room for the special wrench to fit over the casing too. G'Luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: On the 1 star reviews everyone complains about this machine not using enough water however I thought you could manually adjust water levels?\n Answer:","completion":" Everyone is used to water going to the top of the basket on the old machines. The new design, and to meet the new regulations, only allows water to fill half way up the basket. If you don't overfill with clothing, you can't stuff the machines like in the old washers, it works reasonably well .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can I wash a twin bedspread quilted\n Answer:","completion":" I say that you can... I've washed a twin comforter in mine with no problem. It pretty well filled the tub and that's all I washed in that load. Please note that if the washer is the least bit out of level, it will wobble and even \"walk\" across the floor. This is a pretty heavy load and the spin cycle is a speedy 700 revolutions per minute. Also be sure to use HE detergent and maybe just a wee bit more than usual.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: reviews on high efficiency washers vs regular washers\n Answer:","completion":" this machine does an excelleny job. I was told that the real expensive front load machines suffer from drum odors because you can not leave the door open when not in use. You get high effiency from this machine and no issues. I would consult Readers Digest, but I read the reviews of the folks. The best barometer.\n"}

When it looks grungier than that, I put the whole thing in the dishwasher, and it comes out spotless.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Whats the Diameter the fingers at its widest point?\n Answer:","completion":" What do you mean? Do you mean the distance between the fingers?\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you tell me how much space is in between the pegs? Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" An inch. There is a tiny bit of flex in the pegs, so I haven't had any issues. I use it for bottles and pump parts - wish I had it months ago!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many pegs does it have and are they coated with a non-slip substance such as silicone or rubber? Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" The pegs are in a 7 by 8 array, for a total of 56. The ends of the pegs are coated with plastic, a different kind of plastic than the body of the rack; it is slightly less slippery than the body of the rack but I would not call it non-slip. The coating flares out a little, kind of like an elongated matchstick, and this flare provides a bit of mechanical grip on plates. I have never had anything slip off or out of the pegs. I highly recommend this rack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I was thinking about using this as an in-sink dish rack. Is the material something I could drill holes into for drainage?\n Answer:","completion":" It is made of a stiff plastic, so you could probably drill holes in the bottom.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this an electric or gas washer?\n Answer:","completion":" It's electric and a wonderful washer\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the washer fill for the extra rinse or just spritz some water?\n Answer:","completion":" It fills back up for the rinse cycle, so clothes are actually rinsed out. This washer uses water to wash clothes versus the HE models that use \"tumbling and movement\". That's why clothes are so much cleaner. The HE model that I had really was not as energy efficient as it claimed to be because with the self balancing making the cycles long and when the machine was not in use, the lights and the computer system was still on, the only way to make it not \"ghost\" electricity was to unplug it after each use. I so love this simple machine, wish I had purchased it sooner.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the Speed Queen 432 have a buzzer to indicate that the wash cycle is done?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine does not but I find buzzers distracting, so I don't mind. Plus, the machine's spinning makes some noise and I can tell when it's through.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Could I buy two and link them using one as a pre heater to get even hotter water ??\n Answer:","completion":" This isn't an answer to the question, but rather a repeat of the question and a response to the previous \"answers.\" Mr\/Ms Roby, if you don't understand the question, why did you write an answer? Ms Cowgirl, the Product Description says, \"This amazing instant water heater can be connected to the existing hot water piping.\" So perhaps a better explanation is that YOU cannot hook it up to American piping. If NO ONE could hook it up to American piping, it wouldn't have a 4.4-star rating. Mr Curcie, what difference does it make WHY Ms O'Meara wants it hotter? A shower is not the only way people use hot water. Folks running a food truck, for instance, might need hot water over 100 to make hot tea, instant coffee, wash their utensils, etc. Using the example in the Product Description, tap water coming in at 56 will be heated 45 to 101. This is NOT hot enough for hot drinks, as 101 is only 2.4 above body temperature. Great for baby formula; not great for coffee. If the 101 water from one unit can be run through a second unit, a 45 temperature rise will yield 146 water, which IS hot enough for coffee and hot tea. The biggest problem with Amazon's Q&As is people chiming in with \"answers\" when they don't really know the answer. So how about it? Does anyone (including the seller) actually know the answer to this question? Or are we supposed to be satisfied with \"I don't know,\" \"I don't understand,\" \"I could only guess,\" and \"Why would you want to?\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What does vent free mean?? I want to replace a gas hot water heater in my RV trailer which is located inside a cabinet but has an outside vent.\n Answer:","completion":" Vent free means it does not require a vent to the outside in order to be installed. I just installed one in my rv but I found that I had to install it in the basement where there was enough clearance on the top. The exhaust on the top of the excel gets way too hot, so I felt it would be better where there was plenty of room around it so nothing would melt or burn. I love it though. I can happily take a 45 minute shower if I want.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just installed heater works but starting water temp is only 46 deg. (Cold) And I can't seem to get water heater to 100 Degrees.

{"prompt":"Question: i hook up my tankless water heater it go on for 1min then shuts off. and no hot water. can you help\n Answer:","completion":" When u turn on the hot water at the faucet, do u turn on just the hot? Because my heater turns off the moment I turn on the cold water. I think it must have something to do with the amount of pressure the water is coming in and out of the water heater. It has to be at a minimal pressure or the heater will not operate properly. When I turn on my cold water to mix with the hot, I guess it reduces how much pressure I'm pulling from the heater so it turns off. Although when I'm taking a shower, my shower head allows for a higher gpm (gallon per minute), so I can have both the hot and cold water running at the same time in my shower only.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between this and model 10140917? Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" Obviously, the big difference is the price. However, in my research I found the parts that attach to your machine may be slightly different with different part numbers. Therefore, it will not fit your machine hook ups or plug in parts, thus creating a leak or bad electrical connection. To be sure what part # is correct check the part number and match to the part number you are replacing. If there are no numbers on part you want to replace, look at the specific model and make of your machine and match that way. Each manufacturer has specific # on their parts for each model of machine they sell. Descriptions also in listing with part stating what machine or model they go with. Numbers could also be engraved on original part too. If you still aren't 100% sure it's the correct part for your machine, call the 800# for the manufacturer of your machine. They can generally give you help with part numbers. In closing, if you do order the wrong part, Amazon is very good about returns and replacements. Be assured you won't lose out and will be able to exchange for the correct part.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What shape are the ice cubes dispensed? In the picture above, they appear to be like cubes rather than the half moon shapes normally produced.\n Answer:","completion":" the fridge makes half moon shaped cubes, but the crushed ice isnt quite as crushed as ive seen others make. the secondary ice catcher in the freezer section allows you to keep more ice on reserve if needed. the fridge has a ton of space, the led lighting is great, and the combination of those two things make it easy to find what you are looking for. i guessed at the counter depth and the fridge sticks out quite a bit more than i had expected, but i wouldnt exchange it because i love the thing....that and the restocking fee is about a third of the initial cost. good luck, -derek\n"}

The light comes on every 6 months I think and if you do not use that much water, it may still have some life left. I change it once a year. Filter is located between the bottoms of the two fruit\/veggie drawers. Do a search on water filter for this model, or see the filter type once you remove the old filter.

However we were do disappointed after $17k in damage caused to our home by the drain pump falling out the first time, only to have it fall out again. We were out all of our time and money plus had to buy another washer since we would never trust running that one again.

{"prompt":"Question: How well does the autofill work? Does it work with most glasses? Does it work with stock pots?\n Answer:","completion":" Autofill will work with most glasses. Only ones that have had any problem are the ones that are short and come up to the bottom of the sensor. Regarding stock pots, you would have to hold the pot in place and most likely, the \"unstable container\" warning would stop it on Autofill. However, holding it in place with slight pressure against the back of the sensor will fill it like regular fill function. The bottom tray pulls out a few additional inches which allows a pitcher to be placed and Autofilled. One neat thing is that you can have ice in the glass and the sensor picks up the total volume and will not overfill.\n"}

Looking at the actual basket for your model and comparing it to mine, it appears to me your model basket is slightly taller. Not sure due to ok pictures of each. I would only suggest trying it for the price, and be prepared to return. Amazon is usually pretty good in dealing with returns. At least in my experience. If not, go to Kenmore website, search for your model dishwasher and get the exact model number of basket you need. Then google to try and find the best price.\n"}

It has no certification verifying that it removes anything. The Samsung filter cartridge replacement is tested and certified by NSF International to meet or exceed NSF\/ANSI Standards 42 and 53 for the reduction of: 97.4% of Chlorine 99.3% of Lead at pH 6.5 99.3% of Lead at pH 8.5 99.99% of Cysts 98% of Particulates (Class I) 99.1% of Turbidity 94.6% of Atrazine 96.7% of Benzene 99% of Asbestos 99% of Lindane That is why it is more expensive.

{"prompt":"Question: Is there installation along with shipping? or it just ships to you and everything else is done on your own?\n Answer:","completion":" No - you have to install them yourself. You get four big boxes - (2) pedestals, washer, dryer. I think it may be an option to have the units actually delivered inside, but I can't remember. Either way, two strong people should be able to move all four, although the washer is considerably heavier than the dryer. I suggest leaving them in the boxes until you get them to the final spot as it makes them easier to move. Installation itself is not all that complicated. Just follow the instructions and you'll be alright. Also - the dryer ships without an electrical cord. Be sure to get the right one that fits your specific outlet.

My sister has the same refrigerator and has had it fixed four or five times. There was a class action suit against LG for this refrigerator. When the ice maker is working and the water is dispensing all you need is one hand to get water. When the ice maker is broken it does not dispense any water so you don't need any hands at all.\n"}

Would you buy this again?\n Answer:","completion":" We definitely would, no doubt about it. I'm still absolutely amazed at how big this fridge is. It's only downfall is it makes ice a bit slower than some others. This is because the whole unit is in the door, so it likely doesn't freeze water as fast. The ends justify the means though. It still makes ice plenty fast for my family of 4, who use a ton of ice living in AZ in the summertime heat. It just doesn't make it quite fast enough to always have enough ice for our weekend sports for the kids (filling up the small cooler), like our previous fridge was able to keep up with. No biggie though for most people buying this, but figured I'd point this out in case it is a concern for you.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: would this fit a Whirlpool WRS325FDAB 25.4 Cu. Ft. Side-By-Side Refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure that is the right bin for you. In looking at the parts for your refrigerator at a company that does parts for a lot of appliances (http:\/\/www.partselect.com\/PS3489569-Whirlpool-W10321304-Door-Bin.htm?SourceCode=5&SearchTerm=WRS325FDAB&ModelNum=WRS325FDAB) it looks like your bin's measurements are what is listed, by part number, at this site: http:\/\/www.tcapplianceparts.com\/product\/whirlpool-cantilever-bin-part-no-ps3489569-mod-ed25dqxdw04-item-1796791 They do not match the dimensions of the bin you are asking about. I would check the measurements of one of your bins and then make sure you match that with your new purchase. You may even be able to find the part number in your manual. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have model GD25DFXFW02 Will it fit?\n Answer:","completion":" The actual dimensions are : 13\" w ( the back of the tray that fits into the door ), Approx 13.5\" ( the front of the tray) , 6.25\" d , 4\" h. Hope that helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What kind of plastic is it made of ?\n Answer:","completion":" The door bin is clear plastic, with a white plastic rim around the top - matching the bins my Whirlpool Refrigerator\/ Bottom Freezer, Model GB2FHDXWQ05, already has. As one reviewer wrote, it adds storage space to the door, and it is the exact same sturdy clear plastic bin with white plastic top rim, that come with the fridge. This bin is also cheaper to buy through Amazon than anywhere else I've researched. All that said, because different sites have different measurements, I called Whirlpool customer service to ask them if this bin was the right fit for my refrigerator.

{"prompt":"Question: Hi. Which way does the motor turn? clock or counter-clockwise? Thanks in advance! (model #833697).\n Answer:","completion":" Pretty sure it was clockwise, looking at the shaft end.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is any hardware included?\n Answer:","completion":" just some screws and wire nuts\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this an authentic Whirlpool motor or Chinese knock off?\n Answer:","completion":" I got mine a couple of years ago. I don't remember it saying from Whirlpool, but it has worked good ever since. I just assume most things are from China anymore.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the dimension, because the description looks totally wrong.\n Answer:","completion":" I know the one that it replaces is only about an inch thick but when replacing mine found that there was an adapter plate over the hole that holds this size motor so the cheap flat one would fit. I had no problem putting this one in at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why does this show a blade if it does not come with the motor?\n Answer:","completion":" Because the people putting together Amazon product listings make mistakes every once in a while. The important thing is this: if you are replacing the existing motor in your fridge you already have the blades you need attached to the old motor, and it is easy to move the blades from the old motor to the new one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: so this one turns the blades in the wrong direction? it turn counter clockwise. which makes it blow toward the water tray and away from the compressor\n Answer:","completion":" If you reverse the two wires it will spin in the opposite direction. I also think the blade can be flipped if necessary. I'm real sure it will work for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this include the blades?\n Answer:","completion":" no\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The description of this motor states it is .5\" x 1\" x 1.37\". Is that right? It wouldn't be much bigger then a bottle cap.\n Answer:","completion":" It was bigger than that...it was a couple inches around. I would say 3\" at least.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit automatically disable CO2 when the exhaust fan is on? If not, can it be programmed to provide this function?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It disables the exhaust fan for Co2 when Co2 mode is set. It can also work independently using just the recycling timer\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this unit display the actual real time temperature and humidity in the space?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it gives a constant real time update on temp and humidity. Mine is 1 year old working great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit have a CO2 ppm detector?\n Answer:","completion":" It does not. However they do have a controller that does. Its about twice the price but worth it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this allow you to set a low temp. setting to turn fans off and a hight temp setting to turn fans on?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it will.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What if you need to incorporate a heater? It seems the temperature control is for only turning a cooling device on, am I missing something?\n Answer:","completion":" The device has 4 plugs and they are labeled,1.\"cooling output\", 2.\"night Output\", 3.\"CO2 output\" 4.\"humidity output\". The \"cooling output \" plug has temperature settings that can be set,independently, for day and night and will control your a\/c and\/or fans (or ANY device that cools).dead band is adjustable.The cooling device does NOT need to have its own thermostat,but its better if it does ,if its an a\/c or high power draw device. Just make absolutely sure you factor in the start up watts for the device and never exceed the rating.a good rule is to never go above 80% of the maximum.factor for the largest POSSIBLE load. The \"night output\" plug is always on at night(off during the day) and you can plug a heater in there but you would still need the heater to have its own thermostat,as the night output plug is always on at night. The \"CO2 output\" plug is a DAY recycle timer and controls whatever device you have plugged and cycle the power cycle on and off based on the \"on time\" and \"off time\" set.This timer is OFF during night. CO2 isnt used in high enough amounts to have on at night. The \"humidity output\" plug cycles whatever device you have plugged in based on the humidity settings. you can have seperate day and night humidity settings and you can select \"humidity increase\" or \"humidity decrease\" modes.one to humidify and one to de humidify. Dead band is adjustable. it also has a temp\/humidity lock that lets you use fans to cool and remove humidity instead of the a\/c.or split mode for using and a\/c to cool and fans\/dehumidifier to remove moisture. split mode allows independent control. you can also set it to turn off the co2 when the fans run.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If this item does not have a CO2 detector, can you set the time for CO2 production and the CO2 production cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" The Autopilot Digital Environmental Controller (DEC) precisely controls temperature and humidity within your grow area. The DEC coordinates the use of supplemental CO2 injection within the temperature function. The DEC has four outlets and a 15' remote combination probe with highly accurate temperature, humidity and light sensors. Easy to use push button functions are identified on a large digital display. Built in data logger records minimum and maximum temperature and humidity levels. * Combines temperature, humidity and CO2 controls together in one flexible unit with digital precision * Control your temperature and humidity independently or synchronized * Day\/night temperature set points * Remote 15' temperature and humidity sensor NOTE: This controller has a 14.5A maximum load. For higher amperage units, such as A\/C units, it is recommended to use a power expander.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Any information available on how to set up Evolve LTM-5 as a remote switch? (to control remotely another z-wave switch that operates a light)?\n Answer:","completion":" You will have to do it in your controller. First add it to your network and then you can set controls based on your controller. On my Vera Lite it is set up as a group so it can control the loads of other switches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this switch need to be wired by that I mean hard wired into the wall ?\n Answer:","completion":" Yep. It's a bit confusing how they phrase it in the description, so I understand why you would ask this. The accessory switch requires power, i.e. 110v line, neutral, and ground. It communicates with the main switch, or your zwave controller, from there. It's hard wired in the sense that it needs 110v power, but does not directly get wired to the light or other output.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have 6 - 3 way dimmer switches that I want to make Z-Wave. I have the Z-Wave controller. What is the cheapest and easiest way to do that?\n Answer:","completion":" Which controller do you have? The cheapest way (not sure of your location) is to go your local LOWES hardware store and buy the GE IRIS 3- way setup with 2 switches in one box for 44.99. Your Probley going to have alot more questions tho. And you should be asking installation questions. Z-wave switches require a netural wire until non z-wave switches. I feel you should check out the forum of what ever controller your going to use and find out more info before buying. You can ask more questions here also if you'd like.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do I need this switch if a circuit is already wired 3-way or in that case would I just use two Evolve LSM-15s?\n Answer:","completion":" The 3way wiring becomes useless. I use the 5 associated with a 15 or LRM dimmer. You will need an Aeon Labs Minimote or similar to associate them unless you have a controller like Vera. The 5 is basically a scene controller. Actually just replaced a 4way with this configuration today.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: CAN THIS SWITCH ACT AS A SIGNAL REPEATER?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not using it as such, but yes I believe it does act as a repeater\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with different color faceplates?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they do but they are sold separately.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can R410a be used and or mixed with R-22\n Answer:","completion":" absolutely not even if you putting in an empty system that has not been flushed . Flush it maybe even then I would still wonder I the system is cross contaminated\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What size of fitting does this tank take? like thread size.

{"prompt":"Question: is this just a dry\/empty cylinder or is it full of refrigerant?\n Answer:","completion":" Ours was full of refrigerant.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: WHat is the gross (TOTAL) weight of a FULL bottle of R410a, without packaging of course.\n Answer:","completion":" 34 lbs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the canister have to be stored in any special conditions (cool\\dry)?\n Answer:","completion":" yes this refrigerant need to be keep in cool\\dry place and out of direct sun light.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a 9000 BTU Frigidaire mini split with heat pump that need recharge. Any one has any idea how much refrigerant I need using manifold? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" check the label on compressor it will tell how much it holds and witch refrig. to use...it may not be worth repairing....\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Replacement for r22?\n Answer:","completion":" No way! System must be designed for R410a.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do the pedestals are necessary?\n Answer:","completion":" They are more of an option for storage, but no! surely not necessary. I have my washer and dryer unit on hardwood floor. The units come with a wrench to adjust all four legs underneath the washer and dryer units to level them out. I personally like the level of my washer and dryer because I can quickly fling the laundry out of my basket and into the washing\/drying unit so I can proceed with my tasks for the day! I hope this response finds the correct answers you need!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: DO you have the link to buy the device that goes between them?\n Answer:","completion":" There is no device that connects these machines, other than the Stack Kit, which is only needed if the units are being placed with the dryer atop the washer. The ASIN on Amazon of the Stack Kit is B006YBCNFO.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are they sackable?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. You have to buy a device that goes between them, though. I forget what it is called.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this rack fit my GSD3460GOOSS dishwasher?\n Answer:","completion":" yes it will\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will tihis rack fit my GSD4260JOOSS dishwasher?\n Answer:","completion":" Looks like it does, yes: see http:\/\/www.appliancepartspros.com\/ge-rack-asm-lower-wd28x10284-ap4980665.html I bought one of these for my GE Potscrubber 980 not long ago and it was great. Unfortunately the dishwasher just died and wasn't worth repairing, so I have nearly new racks I should look at selling myself.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it fit GE Model 3960LOOSS?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased this for a GE Nautilus. I can't say whether it will definitely fit in the 3960LOOSS, but I believe it's a universal rack for most GE dishwasher models.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this rack fit GE GSD5650D01CC model?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine is a different model than yours and than what is listed. I literally measured and counted spokes, rows, and wheels to ensure it was the same as my previous one. Good luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I bought the ice maker for my back patio. But, on page 1 of the inst. book, it says, do not use outside. Has anyone tried it? I leave in Florida. thx\n Answer:","completion":" I do not use mine outside but know others who do in Az where it's hot\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the wattage and\/or amperage of this ice maker? I am planning to put it in my RV and I wanted to know how long my marine battery will last.\n Answer:","completion":" Hi RVer. Your question was not answered in the manual, but the tag on the machine reads; Ice Making Current 2.1 A and Ice Harvest Current 3.2 A. Hope this is helpful. Enjoy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you fill it with chilled refigerate water to make the ice quicker\n Answer:","completion":" I dont see why not it only makes since. I bought this icemaker and the only issue if any is the ice gets dispenced into the bucket and tends to slope up against the side not filling the bucket all the way up. Craig.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the storage capacity for ice?\n Answer:","completion":" It doesn't store ice. It makes it and you either remove the cubes or the melt back into liquid to make ice again. We emptied each bin and froze in bags in freezer for use when needed or wanted. It does make ice quickly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much water does it's reservoir hold?\n Answer:","completion":" The reservoir holds exactly one gallon of water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 50 lbs. of \"ice storage\" . . . does that mean that it will actually \"store\" ice for an extended period of time (several days, weeks)?\n Answer:","completion":" It will not. Ice will last for hours not days in here as the unit itself is not a \"freezer\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you use the timer? I have read the instructions several times but have yet to figure out out to adjust it...\n Answer:","completion":" We don't really use the timer, but if you want to turn it on or off you hit the timer button twice to turn it off when the ice maker is on, or to turn it on hit the timer button one when the maker is off. You can also unplug it and when you plug it back in the timer is working.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should the LED display stay lit when it is powered on? It is hard to tell when it is actually on....\n Answer:","completion":" The only sure way to tell if it's on is to listen to the noises it makes. The LED display is hard to read and unsatisfactory. Our unit sits on the floor and we have to bend all the way down or go on our knees to see the display. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this icemaker. They just need to improve that display, or place it on the lid, rather than on the front.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: our Dacor hood is about 10 years old, would this be the same bulb as shown? Also, do you have the suction cups to screw it out?\n Answer:","completion":" mine is also that vintage - same bulbs as indicated - The less expensive bulbs don't seem to last - I've had a couple that didn't last 2 weeks - fortunately the let place I bought them refunded my complete order when I complained- vey good! I'm trying the new LED bulbs to see if their lifetime is better. I bought the suction cup to unscrew the bulb a long time back - Almost any hardware store should have something similar - a cup holder with suction cup sounds about the right size. Caution - for a blown bulb, sometimes the suction cup simply pulls the glass from the front of the bulb - need a part of needle node pliers to get the bulb out if this happens.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi! Could some of you tell me if the base of this lightbulb is \"intermediate\"? The details say Base Type E27, which does not help. Thanks!!!\n Answer:","completion":" These bulbs are medium, or standard sized base thread. Known as E27 in Europe (27mm diameter), and E26 in North American( 26mm diameter). They will not fit an intermediate socket. If you are looking for intermediate sized base, their designation is E17 in North America (17mm), and E14 in Europe (14mm diameter).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the same thing as a \"PAR 16\" light, or similar \"standard\" size? Anyone know another way to buy the replacement (other than Dacor)?\n Answer:","completion":" It is a European base JDR E27 I bought mine a few years ago from LSE Inc. (Actually I bought a pair incase they did not match the original brightness). They work great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do i change the bulbs?\n Answer:","completion":" There should be a small suction cup that you apply to the bulb to unscrew it, I can't recall if it came with the bulbs or not. Equivalent would be a small silicone suction cup used to attach hooks and such to windows ,as long as the cup is a bit smaller than the glass on the bulb it should work.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this kit work for Samsung front load washer WF210ANW\/XAA?\n Answer:","completion":" In theory it should. But look at the specs for your washer and check the dimensions in the bearing inner and outer raice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will tis fit my mhwe400ww01, is it a direct fit, are the bearings strong enough to handle the 1100 rpm spin ?\n Answer:","completion":" These will fit that model number. I have to say after a 1 1\/2 years, the bearings are bad again. I'm going to try 1 more set and probably let it go and see if I could afford another washer at that time. I think the design was just bad on this model washer. I'm also going to spend money on changing the shocks and springs which is essentially changing the whole suspension system in the washer. I'm also going to try and load less clothes to see if it will last longer. It did work really well when I first changed it out, but the loud spin cycle is back. I'm just trying to get more than 5 years out of the washer. We also never used the extra high spin cycle. Always changed down to high. Clothes still came out good. Don't know how much that helped in the long run.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how is this mounted--is there several screws that I have to put in my wall?\n Answer:","completion":" the screws that come with this dryer does not hold it on the wall. They are too small and the dryer felt. I had to buy bigger ones to install it on the wall.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do i know if it's wattage is to high? I don't want to blow a fuse.\n Answer:","completion":" It uses 1350 watts, which is less than many hair dryers. Unless you have a unique situation, this should be a non-issue.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Stated dimensions in the description are 22x19x41 inches. I need to know which measurement is the width across and which is its depth when in use?\n Answer:","completion":" The width across is slightly more than 19 inches. The depth is 22 inches. However, when the dryer is in use, the vinyl cover expands from the air blowing. You need to have an inch or 2 clear around the dryer for air circulation. The dryer has holes on the sides and bottom to work. It needs the air circulation. My dryer is mounted about an inch from my bedroom door when open and about 3 inches from my dresser.

{"prompt":"Question: will my 5\"duct size work with the 8\"duct size for this model without making another hole in the wall?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Julie, Like many said it doable but for a 5\" duct might be a little small. My was an 6\" duct and I end up going to Home Depot and get a reducer that cost about $12. I love how it look but installing it was a b*tch. It took a total of about 13 to 14 hours in a whole day for me to install mostly by myself. My wife did help me load it up into the packaging box that it came in. We use the box on top of the stove to support this range to help ease the load of loading it under our cabinet. This sucker weight like 40 to 50 pounds. Some of the nut and bolt that came with the package doesn't feel secure for me. I don't wanted the whole range drop down. I end up using toggle bolt that can handle 80+ lbs. each and use them on the top of the cabinet and use heavy duty dry wall anchor and screws that support 30+ lbs. for the side. This thing wasn't going anyway. For the perfect next time I think I well drill hole that was 1\/4\" bigger for running the power cord thru it. I end being slight not level on the range due to the cord bushing of the power cord on fitting the hole so it bumped 2cm higher and not set flat on it. Mounting the four top screw was a pain. Even with toggle bolt I have to end reverse mount it to make it easier to screw nut into the toggle bolt.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the range hood is defected. What to do???\n Answer:","completion":" go to the original order on amazon, they will connected with the factory to change your parts, you need to describe what happen in detail.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The manual doesn't mention the bolts-n-nuts that came with the package. What's the extra nuts and bolts for? I thought just need the screws to secure?\n Answer:","completion":" It suggests to secure it using as many as screws possible. The hood comes with an extra black plate for hanging it over its back with those extra screws. Mine just hung over my cabinet without the black plate and those extra screws\/nuts, and it works just good enough for us.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this unit have a wall hanger to hold it in place while you secure the mounting screws\/bolts? it looks heavy! or do i need some 2x4 and a jack?\n Answer:","completion":" We put it on a bench to install it. I believe there is a wall hanger.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I locate another brand but is exactly like this, except for the wireless control, It's sell by Cosmo Kitchen Appliances in CA is it the sameone?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure. There are some many options in the market.

{"prompt":"Question: Is the weight a problem I read that it is near 70 pounds\n Answer:","completion":" Actually, I'm not sure since I was not able to install it yet.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this dryer have to be vented outside\n Answer:","completion":" Hey there. No. It doesn't need to be vented outside but I found that if I don't, the windows get steamed up on the cold glass. AS month back I was able to have my windows open and I had no trouble. I am using a \"Indoor Lint Trap Filter\" that cost about $35 bucks from Amazon. I love it but I am going to work on a way to vent it out my window for the winter. I use the dryer about 4 times each week sense I got it and I have not seen any real increases in my electrical bill. Love it. One other thing to add. Keep the internal lint filter clean and you'll get little to none lint out the hose. I used my girlfriends knee high stockings over the end of the exhaust opening and I have not seen any lint at all. I empty the inside lint filter after every load. Best of luck with your purchase and happy Thanksgiving. Hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How much energy does it use? estimated per year? Per hour even would be great?\n Answer:","completion":" I really have no idea...I haven't noticed an increase in my electrical bill. A feature I like about this dryer is that the heat cycle moderates to a cool cycle. I find that my clothes are dry far sooner than I expected and I end up turning off the dryer long before the cycle is complete. I love my little dryer. Simple to use and does what it is supposed to without a problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does one separate the first and second filters to remove the lint (not the felt circle but the first two)?\n Answer:","completion":" At first it is kind of difficult. You have to pry open the filter. I used a knife. There are small tabs that hold the filter together. Once you pry them apart. it becomes much easier. Now I don't have to do that. They come apart very easily now. Hope this helps.\n"}

Customer service: 166 Torbay Rd. mark ham, ON, L3r Canada. 1-888-329-8832. After glancing over the list of providing manufacturers, I'd guess the dryer is made in China. Could be India, but I doubt that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it need to be vented?\n Answer:","completion":" I asked this question over and over before I bought mine. Finally I took the plunge and here's what I know. I have great luck venting the dryer into the little venting attachment that's only about $8 or something. I thought it would create way too much humidity in my little cabin. Not so. I was running it during the hottest, most humid months of last summer with no problem. I ALSO have the same dryer in my apartment (I live in a different place in the winter. Why? Have you every been in northern Wisconsin in the winter? HAHA) and I don't vent it. It does create some humidity, but it's fine with me. I guess I wouldn't put it right next to Grandma's 150-year-old antique buffet, lest it makes it fall apart. I absolutely love my Sonya dryers. Highly recommended.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know the size of these cutouts which hold individual spoon? I would like to confirm they can indeed fit the spoons I have...\n Answer:","completion":" To be honest, I pulled those things off. They were annoying and just got on he way.

{"prompt":"Question: Is the color of this as shown? My dishwasher tray is actually a light grey, this appears to be black\/dark grey.\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, the silverware tray is a dark gray.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the inside diameter (or outside diameter if already installed) of the hose?\n Answer:","completion":" 1\/2 inch inner diameter\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the inside diameter of this hose?\n Answer:","completion":" Also just an fyi, be careful with the hoses that have an elbow built-in, because many of them might have a 1\/2 I.D. (3\/4O.D.) hose, but then they make the actual elbow part with a smaller inside diameter, such as 3\/8 which will restrict the flow of water right at that elbow and kinda defeating the whole point of having a larger inside diameter hose.. I personally just got the exact hose you had asked the question on, two 6 foot hoses and one 5 foot hose, both identical brands just different length and they work great. I actually just ordered another set right now to replace out my mother's old rubber hoses.. Let me know if you have any other questions, -Ken\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this one or two hoses?\n Answer:","completion":" I just re-checked the link to this product on Amazon. This is \"One\" each hose. Some of these do come in sets. Not this one. Happy with the hose with one qualification--the rubber washers. Look for Made in USA washers on Amazon. Well worth the minor cost. If you need a link to the washers I purchased let me know.

{"prompt":"Question: Frigidaire's website shows the depth as 21 3\/4, this description shows 21\". What is the exact depth?\n Answer:","completion":" Cooktop has a slightly bowed front edge. The largest deminsion is front to back through the middle of the knobs. Mine measures 21 and 1\/4 inches front to back. Of course the part of the stove that fits below countertop is smaller.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do any of you vent your dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" No, I don't. I've had it for about 9 months and only put the plastic vent looking piece on top and use it like that. It sits in my living room corner. It blows warm air, so it can get a little warm in the room during warmer days. All you need to do is crack a window or door open.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need to vent this to the outside? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" I have mine sitting on the floor right by the window and all I do is crack my window open to let out the heat.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Dose it come with a Indoor Dryer Vent ? and Is it easy to clean the filter net?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do I really need a venting hose?\n Answer:","completion":" That would depend on whether you like warm moist air in the room where your dryer is located. I live in the southeast and we have enough humidity this time of year and beyond that I don't want any more steamy air in my room. I open the window just enough for the venting hose to rest between the sill and the bottom of the open window. I put an old large beach towel next to the venting hose to keep hot air from getting inside. I would also expect that, over time, you might get some mildew if you don't vent at all. I do not like the tub vent kit since it's difficult for my arthritic hands to put the top and bottom together. There's definite room for improvement here, Panda!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it plug into a regular outlet??\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it does. Tanya D. You need an 3 prong outlet or adapter piece.. Someone else also posted in their review questions, don't have too many appliances going that pull a lot of current while using it. It has blown a fuse when too many things are going. As it did with me.. But, outside of that, its very useful.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this dryer in a room with no windows? Will I have to buy a vent kit? Many thanks\n Answer:","completion":" In my opinion - MAYBE. It comes with a four-piece hard plastic, sort of \"vent stack\" with top connection curved as if to direct the warm air that comes out of the dryer towards an outlet for the hot air. I can roll mine right up to a window so I didn't need to buy flex-duct or anything to extend its venting. In the instructions it said something like - if you prefer not to vent the dryer through a window, you may just enjoy the 'pleasant warming' it will provide to your room. Must be cold year round in China, huh? I didn't mind a little 'warming' in Jan-Feb. But it's in the 90's now in NYC. Don't think I'd want to run it unvented in a windowless room today. But appears - from the instructions - to be possible; although maybe not always a practical idea. But that's where we come back to the flex duct - you can buy that stuff by the mile I think, if you need to.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the size in inches or centimeters,can I hang the dryer on the wall, my old one hangs\n Answer:","completion":" I installed the two I bought on the wall about five feet of the ground. Since it was intalled at the corner of the room, it was easy to build a platform in wood to sit the dryers on top. My tenants like the fact it is mounted at about eye level and does not clutter the floor. Don't know if I have answered your question\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Everyone seems to be fully focused on the amount of saving!

I can smell and taste the chlorine and have always bought bottled water, until this new refrigerator. I tried the water from the dispenser and it is fine. After buying the compatible filter after the first six months, I see no difference in the quality. It is just as good as the original GE filter and will continue to purchase them from the seller I used. Saving on both filters and bottled water.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the NSF Certification numbers for this filter, and where is it made?\n Answer:","completion":" Im not sure if this is what you are asking for, the box says the filter has been tested by the manufacturer against ANSI\/NSF Standard 42 for the reduction of chlorine,tastes,and odors. It doesn't actually have the NSF stamp on it though like the ge water filter box that i have. It is made in the USA and the ge box that I have says assembled in Eagan,MN. I never really paid much attention until i was asked this question. I hope this helps W floyd\n"}

They are not 10 panels of 8x4's; this is the total area they cover.

{"prompt":"Question: how do I make the LG machine washer front load take more water?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not quite sure I understand the question. Generally speaking my answer to ANY question pertaining to this model is A) RETURN IT NOW!!!! If it is less than 30 days old, or whatever window from the place of purchase. I wish dearly someone had given me that advice when I made the HORRID mistake of purchasing this worthless machine. B) Buy another washing machine that is NOT LG. I had to buy a GE about 6 months after I purchased this model BRAND NEW. but FINALLY i have clean clothes!!!! When I was using this NIGHTMARE machine, I would have to set it on \"Bulky bedding\" setting in order to get enough water in the drum to actually get the clothes wet enough to get clean. So yes, you have to set it to \"bulky \/ bedding\", stand over the machine for however long it takes to fill, then pause it, power off, then power back on and then chose the appropriate wash setting. WAY TO GO LG!!!!!!!! Congratulations on making the WORST most useless washing machine EVER!!!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you open the door and add another piece of laundry after the machine has started? I think they call it a \"pause\" function.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, there is a \"pause\" function. Still extremely happy with my purchase of this machine.

What's wrong?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't had that problem. I don't see that you have a choice, but to return this one too.i. I know it's such a hassle, but I returned two. I bought the LG, never had any machine clean that well and clothes came out almost dry. I loved the machine but it kept getting off balance. A few times it stopped and wouldn't right itself so back it went to Lowes. I ordered a whirlpool. Didn't like that at all. So, then I returned the Whirlpool to Lowes and reordered another Wt110. Took nerve to do that (: I haven't had any problems with it, but it seems to be an entirely different machine. No balance problems but it doesn't clean or treat my clothes as gentley as the first. It's still better than the Whirlpool . Lowes was wonderful to work with.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Why does this machine bother to include 5 temperature settings when anything other than \"hot\" gives cold water. Where is the real \"warm\" water option?\n Answer:","completion":" It all depends on how \"hot\" your water heater is and how cold your line is coming in from the street. If your water heater is less than 125 degrees Fahrenheit, you'll get a cooler water than warm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it have a built in water heater?\n Answer:","completion":" It has hot and cold water hoses, same as a standard washer. It does not heat water itself. I have been using mine for a month now and am pleased with the overall quality. It takes a little longer to dry than a vented dryer but it does work.

{"prompt":"Question: How are the Oxygen Adsorbers used\n Answer:","completion":" What makes food go stale and spoil quickly is oxygen, by using these oxygen absorbers they reduce that. I dehydrate fruit and vegetables in a food dehydrator then place them in clean mason jars and add one oxygen absorber and close up the jar. In a about 4-6 hours you will hear the top pop inward and the oxygen has been taken out. These jars I use in daily cooking. For long-term food storage I put the dehydrated food into a vacuum seal bag and put in one oxygen absorber then vacuum seal removing all the air, this bag is put into a mylar bag and sealed, then put into a 5-gallon bucket with two oxygen absorbers (food can last for 20 years). All the food we have done this with has been perfect. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do i need more than 1-100cc for 1qt vac packed quart jar.\n Answer:","completion":" No. the 300cc size says it is good for a gallon. so one should be fine for a quart jar.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I noticed this morning there was moisture on the inside of the jar I keep them in and they feel hot when touched. Is this normal? Are they still good?\n Answer:","completion":" Probably not. They react to the O2 in whatever environment they are in. If you are keeping them in a mason jar there is a lot of O2 in there, especially if you are constantly opening the jar. Best way to use them is to plan ahead and use them only as needed. I use them when dehydrating vegetables or making jerky. I portion out the vegetables or jerky into vacuum bags, open the vacuum bag containing the Oxy-Sorbs, take out the number required and immediately reseal the bag containing them. I then put a Oxy-Sorb AND a desiccant packet into the vacuum bag with the product and seal it. I keep all the dehydrated products in PLASTIC .50 caliber ammo cans in a freezer, (labeled, dated, etc.) and have found NO deterioration in the products for over 3 years. The Oxy-Sorb is great for long-term storage of products, if used properly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What would the shelf life be of jerky sealed with these in mylar bags at ROOM TEMPERATURE?\n Answer:","completion":" You would need to vacuum seal the jerky with these oxygen absorbers to make the self life last a while, and then you can put the vacumm sealed jerky into a Mylar bag with a couple oxygen absorbers and seal. That would increase the life of the jerky. Since jerky has fat it can go rancid the the self life will not be very long. maybe 6 months to a year if vacuum sealed and then put in Mylar bag.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you properly close and seal the bag once you have opened it?\n Answer:","completion":" with a bag sealer....same way you close the food storage bag after placing the correct amount of absorbers in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I PURCHASED OXY SORB 100CC had no knowledge of use of. Opened pack took some out.. Unused ones got hot &amp; indicator purple. R they now bad\n Answer:","completion":" If you didn't reseal the package in something air-tight ( like a jar) then they are probably bad. You can test if you fill a jar with something simple ( rice, beans, etc) and put one or more in, seal the jar, and see if the lid \"pops\" down via vacuum pressure- That would indicate the rest are still probably good. However, I also found with mine that a lot of them were not good from the get-go, even after keeping them in an airtight jar.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: So we put an entire packet into what you are about to seal? Making baked goods to ship. Will these help our goods stay fresh longer while shipping?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely, they will stay fresh as long as the container isn't opened or damaged. Suggest maybe a tin can to shop in. They are great for long term storage also.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What's the shelf life?\n Answer:","completion":" Keep the UNUSED product in a vacuum-sealed bag and they last forever.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should these little 100cc absorbers warm up when exposed to air?\n Answer:","completion":" I have not noticed them warming up. I usually put them in a vacuum zip lock type of storage bag right away. If you leave them out too long they will be unable to absorb oxygen in a closed environment.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to give sealed (quart) gift bags of buttered, seasoned popcorn to friends. How long will the 100cc packets keep the bags fresh? HELP!\n Answer:","completion":" The packets should keep the the popcorn fresh as long as the bag is closed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this make \"soft\" ice (easy to chew instead of solid blocks)?\n Answer:","completion":" It makes round blocks. Not easy to chew.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just received this product this week. I waited two days before turning it now. Added water, but it has been two hours and no cubes. Any ideas?\n Answer:","completion":" Turn the machine off and unplug it from the power outlet. Allow it to sit and hour or two unplugged, and then empty out all water you may have put in the machine. Put new water into the reservoir making certain you do not fill it above the maximum fill line. Distilled water is best, and will save you time down the road from having to clean off excessive mineral deposits from the freezing elements, but at minimum use good filtered water and not the junk that comes straight from the faucet. Next, plug the machine back in and press the power button. Do not attempt to set the clock or the timer. Ignore those buttons completely. Select your ice size (it really doesn't matter which one you choose just to test the machine - any size will do.) You should almost immediately hear the machine pumping water from the reservoir into the freezing chamber. It will sound like water quietly trickling and lasts a couple of seconds. If you hear that, you know the pump is working. You should also hear the compressor kick on after the water has been pumped into the freezing chamber, and if you place your hand next to the the exhaust port you ought to begin feeling slightly warmed air blowing out. Within 10 to 12 minutes your first batch of ice will be done. You hear very audibly when the machine slides the ice off the freezing elements and they tumble onto a temporary holding platform. Then you will hear the ice being raised up on the platform and pushed off of it down into the catch basket. The clattering of the ice is unmistakable. If these things do not happen within 12 to 15 minutes of when you turned the power on, something is not right with the machine. You'll most likely need to notify Amazon and have it replaced.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It sounds as though it makes ice very quickly, but after they fall into the storage bin, they no longer stay frozen. Is this true? How much usable ice\n Answer:","completion":" The ice cubes fall into the storage bin and they melt very little because all the ice cubes create a \"cold\" temperature in the bin. Once the bin becomes full the ice maker stops making ice until the bin is emptied. I have been gone longer than six hours and the cubes still very large with minimal melting. The ice maker has great insulation to keep the temperature as cold as possible.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are some of the defects that require the unit to be returned?\n Answer:","completion":" If this is the same product that I own (it looks like it) I have found NO defects in it. It makes ice quickly. It obviously isn't a freezer, so one shouldn't expect it to stay frozen for an extended period.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What method\/s work best to drain the unit? It was mentioned that a filter slowed the process, is it removable?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the product has a drain however, drain hole is small and drainage is slow. I have the unit next to a sink, therefore - I manually empty the water out by just tipping it over to empty the water. The unit is heavy - so the process is rather clumsy. I would not be deterred from purchasing the product due to that issue.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I like the crystal ice cubes, I'm tired of the white bitter-flavor ice of my fridge. Is it possible with this ice maker?\n Answer:","completion":" To answer your question, I must address your concerns about \"white\" and \"bitter-flavor\" separately. Yes, these ice cubes are white, not crystal clear. The white color is from air entrapped as the cubes form on the refrigerated rods. The entrapped air makes the ice cubes \"soft\" and easily chewed if you are inclined to chew ice. We love this consistency. These ice cubes do not, however, have a bitter flavor. As I stated in my review, you must clean the ice maker when you first use it to get rid of the slight \"new plastic\" taste, but after that the ice does not have any bad flavor. We love this ice machine! Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Help- it leaks!! We just got ours set up today. It works quickly and makes good ice but we can't ignore the leak.

Anyone else experience this?\n Answer:","completion":" Nope, what we hear is the water filling and the flap rising but it isnt loud, screeching, or scraping. You may need to exchange your unit. There may be a defect with that particular one. Good Luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know where I can get install instructions for this on a kitchenaid KUDS30IXWH1\n Answer:","completion":" http:\/\/www.appliancepartspros.com\/upper-rack-track-parts-for-kitchenaid-kuds30ixwh1.html Open the link showing a diagram of your top rack. Part number 2 is the part you are looking at on Amazon. Remove rack from dishwasher (there is a retainer at the end of each drawer track that needs to be either removed or opened and the tray will slide out). Carefully unclip Part #11 from the rack and slide down ward until it will unclip from the rack adjuster. Mine were very brittle from age and I snapped one off. Remove second retaining clip part #12. Hard to explain how to do this, but it is not difficult. Release the middle of it, slide it upward and and it will come off. Remove the last retainer, part #9. I used a small screw driver to assist in releasing it. Next use a small screw driver to pry apart parts 8 & 10. The top part is tabbed and the bottom part snaps together so I gently pried it apart from the bottom sides (there was a small notch i could easily get into). The rack adjuster will now slide off. Do one at a time and use the other as a reference. Assembly is the reverse. Take you time - shouldn't take over 45-60 minutes. First side takes the longest, after you do one the other is easy. Hope this helps.\n"}

I run my dishwasher every day and I have replaced these parts once a year. I bought it in October of 2012 and replaced them in October of 2013 and 2014.

{"prompt":"Question: Do the filters have expiration dates? I'm wondering if it's worth buying more than one at a time if they are only good for a certain amount of time.\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't see a expiration date on the box.

How can I find out if the filter fits this model?\n Answer:","completion":" If it currently has a filter, remove it and order the same thing. I did a Google search to find dealers.

I hope you find out because it sure was an expensive pressure cooker that way. Did use the precision as a gift but still.

{"prompt":"Question: DOSE THIS NUWAVE 2 . STAY AT 40c on the low setting . IT is 49c . THE Thermometer says so .\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure. On low we're supposed register it at 100, but I find it is not a true reading. It seems to run hotter on all settings. The more I use mine, the less satisfied I am with this product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what cookware does it work with or does not work with?\n Answer:","completion":" The only cookware that can be used on an Induction cook top is ones that can be magnetized. Get a small magnet and test the bottom of the ones you already have. If you don't have enough, take the magnet with you when you shop. Some pans already say induction ready on the bottom. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The actual cooking\/heating area is 9\" correct? How does that work if I want to use a 12\" skillet?\n Answer:","completion":" Instructions that came with it recommend not using larger than a 10\" skillet. I use a 2\" deep fryer 10\" skillet and A brabd of dutch oven like the expensive pans because they are large and sides angle in to fit inside the largest ring in the PIC. I haven't had any issues with the size at all. I have noticed the heated surface is hotter in the center and is less hot around outside edge. When I am browning a large amount of hamburger in my 2\" deep skillet, I have to move meat from outside to inside where it will brown faster unless I up the temp. It will cook, but not as quickly as inside ring. I guess that is true with most burners, but I do wish Nuwave would make a 12\". Bottom line is the burner really works and is worth purchasing. I have a microwave\/convection oven, a 6 qt Nesco Roaster and this Nuwave PIC. I live in a 2 yr old RV and have never used my stove or oven.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will cast iron pots work on the PIC?\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this a back exhaust\n Answer:","completion":" I think it can be back or top. We ran ours up the top through the chimney provided.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do I need an extension for a 10' ceiling? If so, do you sell one?\n Answer:","completion":" My 8'1\" ceiling allowed me to extend mine only about 2\". This left about 15\" of chimney extension unused. If my calculations are correct, I believe you will need an additional 8\" of chimney after fully extended. My measurements are with the vent hood mounted 25\" above my stove surface. The chimney is 17\" with a 17\" extension supplied. I do not know if they sell extensions separate but my guess is they probably do and I would call the company if I were you, just to be sure! GoodLuck .... I LOVE MINE :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to know what width and depth of the chimney are and whether it can cover an 8\" duct at the top\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with flexible 6 in duct. You would need 8 in to 6 in duct reducer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are there extensions available?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, I'm not quite sure what extensions you would be referring to. I was able to google Golden Vantage and get a phone number because I first ordered the wrong size, they were very easy to talk to (cost me $80 to ship it back!). The unit I bought looks and runs great and was a good value for the money.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this work as a ductless range hood? Or does it have to be vented outside\n Answer:","completion":" Ours is vented outside, but it can be used as a ductless range hood if you prefer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, what is the depth of this hood, measured from the fan base to the chimney extension fully extended? I'd like this to be at least 41.7\". Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry but this is about 36\" tall and you would need a different top extendion but you can find them online\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where do I find installation instructions, I have misplaced mine...\n Answer:","completion":" Installation instructions really aren't very helpful. They are terribly translated engrish and basically say: screw into wall, use 6\" duct to exhaust to exterior of building. Probably would be better to find a generic hood vent install guide on a blog or YouTube.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the maximum distance the bottom of the hood hangs from the ceiling once attached?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine hangs down 30\" for an 8 ft. ceiling, It was actually made for a 9 ft. ceiling which would allow it to hang down at least 42\". They said it would work for an 8 ft. ceiling , but I had to cut some off the brackets and the stainless steel columns to make it work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a minimum height? I have about 22\" height to work with. Can only one of the 19\" chimney's be used or will the two \"telescope\" so it's 19\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they are adjustable. They will telescope\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is their an attachment we can buy? We have 10ft ceilings.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think you need one. We have 9 ft ceilings and set it at the highest adjustment to allow for a more comfortable work area and better looking island. The exhaust is perfectly adequate for the bigger gap between stove and hood. . Should be fine to set at the lower point for 10 ft ceilings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this model to be used for an island only?\n Answer:","completion":" It is finished on all four sides as if intended to be used in an island or peninsula. However I do not see any reason why you would not be able to use it close to a wall. Just bear in mind that the hood part sticks out further than the chase on all four sides and plan accordingly\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How can I get instruction book to install the hood, therewas no book in a package?\n Answer:","completion":" here is a pdf link: http:\/\/akdytrading.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Golden-Vantage-10A3-Wall-Mount-range-hood.pdf i love my hood, installation was not easy (im a pro plumber and damn good at everything else). goodluck!! This is the distributors phone number (626) 350-8360. They arent very attentive to the phone, but they will get back to you and accommodate a guide. put a surge protector where you plug in!!!!!! motherboard can fry in lightning storm\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what do i need to use as in a ductless application?\n Answer:","completion":" sounds like you need to buy a model that uses ductless venting. This model doesnt have that feature. Golden vantage has several models that come with a ductless vent although they dont work well but something is better than nothing!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you have extensions for a 10 ft ceiling\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry no...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this product come with the install kit?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe this came with everything needed to install up to the ceiling. We used it for an island range. Once installed, it looks awesome--more expensive than it actually was. I am happy with the level of air extraction despite not having a wall behind the range to channel steam up. The 4 LED lights are good enough to light the cooking area, although they do have a blue cast kind of like old school fluorescent lights which looks a little eerie. I am not sure if these can be replaced with LEDs with a warmer cast. When running, it is a little noisy. The removable metal vents tend to rattle against the metal vent openings in the main housing. This can probably be solved with foam tape. I am surprised that it did not come with foam gaskets around the vent openings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this hood is ductless ?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry I do not know. This hood is still sealed in the box as I ordered the island hood by mistake for a remodel and when we discovered it was the wrong one it was to late to return.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: it will fit model#LSC26905tt ?\n Answer:","completion":" e-mail me what year is this refrigerator and what is a serial number to jjstaniek@yahoo.com\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this fit model LG LSC26905TT?\n Answer:","completion":" You'll want to confirm with a service manual but I have the LSC27910ST which looks almost identical to your model and it was a perfect fit. I'd hit google with \"LSC26905TT water valve\" to be sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it work for r LG LSC27921ST?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Same model as mine, made in 2010. Water stopped dispensing and this fixed it. Located in back of fridge in bottom right corner.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this have all electrical wiring connected, I need to replace that as well\n Answer:","completion":" As I put it in it was \"plug and play\". I did not have to modify or change any other parts - although it was a bit fiddly as there was not much slack in the connecting water pipes.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit LG refrigerator LSC 27950SB?\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will they fit a kitchen aid?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. Mine is a Kitchen Aid and it works perfectly. There are white knobs protruding from the outside of the metal \"basket\" into which the bag goes and there are holes in the plastic bags which will fit perfectly around those knobs holding the bag in place. I used to get the paper bags from Sears. They would occasionally leak and fall apart when I pulled the bag out if the kids accidentally put something really moist in the compactor. The plastic bags are lighter, easier to handle and have never leaked. I was actually skeptical that they would do the job but they are far superior. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are twist ties included?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they are\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these have the mounting holes in the sides for the Kenmore compactor?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes They are perfect I have a kenmore and ge Compactor and they fit Beautifully in both of them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I got this item and I'm having a lot of problems with lint. The lint filter is a useless, don't hold nothing! Please I need help with the lint.\n Answer:","completion":" I've had this machine for over a year, it works great but if you have clothes that tend to shed a lot you will have lint issues. in this machine it only takes a few minutes to was clothes. It is not like the regular washers. As a rule of thumb if it is an item being washed just because I wore it once I use the three minute cycle, if I wore it outside and it got dirty I adjust the time accordingly. Lightly dirty about 6 minutes, moderate dirty 9 minutes and heavy grime 12 minutes. You will have to play with the times and degree of dirtyness. Overall these are great machines for an apartment dweller. Unfortunately they do have some limits. If you are getting a lot of lint, try decreaseing the time especially if the clothing is not grimey. Usually an item worn on one or two days just needs a light washing in this machine. I usually run the extractor for 2 minutes. Most loads take a total of 5 minutes start to finish.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone give me a concrete estimate of how many pieces of clothing this can fit? How many shirts, how many pant, how many towels etc.\n Answer:","completion":" All depend on the sizes. I wear x-large shirts and I can fit 5-6 if they are lightweight. Bluejeans, 1-2. If there is too much, nothing moves. Bathtowels-large only 2. Smaller towels 4-5 plus washrags. most loads are best if they are combinations of face towels, washrags, shorts and shirts. 2 shirts, 2 shorts, 3 face towels, and multiple washrags fits fine. If you do sheets, one at a time with something else is best. If you wash both at a time, which you can they fit, they get wrapped up in each other and neither gets washed. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The box that it arrives by fedex, does it say washing machine because landlord and nosey neighbors may have a problem. Del. 5\/1 but I'm at work.\n Answer:","completion":" No. My box just said Panda XPB36. There were no diagrams on the box either.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: So, this has to be plugged in AND near a sink, or such? That worries me that my counter won't be big enough, etc.?\n Answer:","completion":" This is a floor model, easy to move. I drain it in the shower.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What's the difference between model XPB36 and PAN30?\n Answer:","completion":" The XPB36 probably needs to sit on the floor as the drain hose has to be lifted 7 inches higher than its connection point to the machine. The PAN30 can sit on the counter or anywhere and the drain hose needs to be laid flat or dropped into a container\/sink large enough to catch all the water that drains out. The PAN30 drains by gravity. Hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this designed and sized to be aconmidating for use in an RV or Travel Trailer?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I use mine in our motorhome. I put it in the shower and use my hand-shower head to fill it and just let it drain out the drain hole of the shower. Works great for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does the spin dryer drain? Does it utilize the hose?\n Answer:","completion":" When you use the spinner, it drains to the same pump the washer bin drains to. In other words, if you hook the drain tube to your sink and switch it to drain, the spinner water will drain out of that as well. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this machine vibrate much? I live on the third floor, and can't have it banging, or movind\n Answer:","completion":" If you overload the spin dryer it will vibrate at first but as soon as it picks up spead it does not. just don't overload it also I have the bigger one so this is my opinion having the larger one the one that's does twelve pounds of laundry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this unit compare to the older Panda washer without the integral spinner? Is the washer part larger, easier to use? Already use the Panda with separate spinner; would there be any benefit in getting this unit to replace existing arrangement?\n Answer:","completion":" This is not actually a newer model, but rather a different one. The washer is a bit larger I would say, but in practicality it has the same power. The built in spinner allows for easy transfer of sopping wet clothing without drips on the floor. You can even pull them out of the wash basin while it is still full and throw them right in the spinner to do a rinse and dry. In the end though, if you are thinking about putting down another $150ish bucks when you already have the standalone panda, I would HIGHLY recommend getting the 3,200 RPM spinner with the stainless drum here on Amazon. It is somewhere around that price, but it can hold an entire load from the Panda, and will dry the clothes to almost 100% dry in just a few minutes. This dual unit has a 120 watt 1,300 RPM (The smaller stand alone spinner is actually faster at 1,600 RPM!) spinner that holds less than half of one load from the washing side. The 3,200 RPM one has 400 watts of power and can hold over 11lbs of clothes! Unless the drain pump is super important to you I would skip this one. If I were you I would keep the stand alone Panda and upgrade your dryer! :) Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I received my Panda washer and have all ready lost my instructions! Do I fill the water to below the lint trap or just above it? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Fill up to below side opening on right. Cloths must wash loosely. Beware of knotting. Dont use a lot of detergent. Use liquid soap. Make sure drain hose is secured. Do not overload spinner. It is a hands on machine works great for small easy washes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it not work on a stainless steel dishwasher?\n Answer:","completion":" It will work on stainless. We have it on our fridge door.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my dishwasher has a piece at the bottom where it opens and then there is another small piece of metal. Has anyone had to cut it? can you send pics\n Answer:","completion":" We do not have any pictures of this item being altered and it is not suggested.\n"}

It looks like it is used for all of the models. I looked at a picture of your model and it looks exactly the same as ours, must be just when it was made. When I read about this when our washer broke, they said it happens a lot since the old sensor was not as durable, so this part number is the new better style. So I bet it will fit fine. My husband fixed it quick. There is a utube video online showing how to take off the back of the washer and how to put on the new sensor, so check that out.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this sump assembly fit on the LG dishwasher model LDS4821ST? There were two conflicting answers when someone asked previously. Wanted to be sure\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does fit ...I just needed one piece of it but I installed the whole thing and kept old one for parts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this sump assembly fit on the LG dishwasher model LDS4821ST ?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure. This part did NOT fit my LG dishwasher which is a 2009 model no. LDF7932ST. The correct part no. For my DW is AJH31248604. When I ordered the part from Amazon I gave them my machine model no. Only as I did not know any part numbers. They sent me the no. 3485ED1002B which did not fit. I eventually had to return this part after I received and installed the correct one. My account was credited for the cost of the part.. I had to pay the shipping, each way ($15.00 x2), and that is not right. The big problem with Amazon is you cannot contact them.. Ther is no phone no. If you email them its generic I.e. they don't read your explanation. I was told by an authorized LG serviceman that this part no. Is used on all late model machines I.e. post 2004. The part you are asking about and I received in error is for older machines I.e. 2004 and earlier. I would check to be sure you are getting the correct part number. LG makes all these parts. The install is involved but anyone with moderate to good mechanical appitude can do it in about two hours. Go to you tube to watch an excellent video. Good luck, my machine is now better than it was when new. I believe I had a defective part from the start.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does 3485ED1002B is equivalent to 3485ED1002A?\n Answer:","completion":" As a general rule, when the part numbers are identical except for the last letter, especially from an A to a B, the change of the last letter is to indicate that a newer version has been released. This is much the same as software programs that have updates that are sequentially numbered. This is my experience as a maintenence professional but you could check with a parts professional for insight.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will this fit a 7 1\/2' cieling?\n Answer:","completion":" It should. Mine are about 9 ft and it fits perfectly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of controls does this have? Number of speeds, clock, timer?\n Answer:","completion":" It has number of speeds, clock, and a time. I don't use the clock much because it only displays in military time, nor the timer just because I've never spent the time to figure it out (it doesn't look immediately intuitive).\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with 84\" ceilings\/7ft? It appears to come in 2 sections. I'll be using ventless.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it should... The two sections collapse inside one another. This looks very nice on the wall, but a serious pain to put up. Do you really have 7 foot ceilings in your kitchen?\n"}

Is there an extension kit and where would I purchase it?\n Answer:","completion":" You will need to order directly from the manufacture.

{"prompt":"Question: Thanks for your answers to my previous question. We will have to connect to a soffit, that is about 4 feet above the range, would it be a problem?\n Answer:","completion":" Height without upper extension is 19\". I see too small rectangular openings 5\" below the top edge of upper extension, where it connects to the ceiling. if these openings are not important then you can get rid of the upper extension, otherwise the minimum height becomes around 24\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: HI I just wanted to check the metal thickness you say it is 23 gauge is this correct this seems very thin and can deform easy. thanks for your time.\n Answer:","completion":" I do not recall mentioning the gauge of the stainless in my review. All of the stainless steel parts are durable and not prone to deformation. I have moved the vent off the wall twice to paint and trim with no damage or issues.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be mounted to the ceiling or is it Wall Mount only?\n Answer:","completion":" Wall mount only\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I change the time on the clock\n Answer:","completion":" Press and Hold the clock button down until the hours blink Press the fan + or - to move the hours up or down (it is a 24 hour clock, so 1 p.m. will be 13).

{"prompt":"Question: I've noticed many people mention the time on this hood. Is your only option military time?\n Answer:","completion":" If there is a way to change it from a 24-hour clock, I have yet to find it. The display is small, so it really isn't a problem. Having lived in Europe and been in the military, the 24-clock doesn't bother me in the least. From a product viewpoint, it would have been better if the manufacturer made it more adaptable to the way people are comfortable viewing the time of day.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone have problem with this range hood going beserk? It turns on and off on its own whenever it feels like it.\n Answer:","completion":" Never had any problems except the military time format.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this recirculating?\n Answer:","completion":" No it is not. We purchased this unit with the understanding it was recirculating but it is not. Beautiful unit and it works great when vented but customer service from DKNY direct is below what we expected.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a 9' ceiling but this product only fits 8-8.5' ceiling.Does anyone know which extension to buy that would work with this model 198KN3 30\".\n Answer:","completion":" I had a very bad experience with akdy. They sent a previously returned vent cover, clearly scratched. They sent me a replacement vent for a completely different hood and then sent a third that still doesn't fit right. Pay the extra money for a better product that services the customers better. Very poor experience with akdy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We have 10-foot ceilings so we need an extension. What are the chimney dimensions? Which extension from therangehoodstore.com would work?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't answer this because we have 8 foot ceilings and we installed as an internal fan unit, no chimney. I can tell you that this hood looks fantastic, however the clock is fast on ours and at times the digital fan settings will not work. If I play with them I can usually get them to work. Still, for the price we paid, it's a bargain and people always comment on it thinking we spent thousands on it. I've never measured the opening. I wish I could help more.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this a ductless and ventless\n Answer:","completion":" No, it has flexible duct that needs to be run to an outside vent or attic\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: where do the rubber mounts go on the back of the vent hood?\n Answer:","completion":" Great question, I didn't use them. By the way, this is a really nice hood. It works really well and is not loud. The only point I have about it is I cannot seem to figure out how to get the clock to read 12 hour time instead of a 24 hour clock(military time). That's a little annoying, other than that I think you'll be happy. Without the rubber mounts is doesn't rattle at all. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the lights in the front ? Appears to be by pic but want to be sure\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the lights are on both front corners and are ok, not really bright but will do the job. I have recessed lighting in the ceiling as well and half the time turn those on as well for better lighting. It's a nice unit, the vent works very well and is pretty quite. I installed this with my neighbor and it was a bit of a job getting it centered and proper height. It looks good and works quite well, I would recommend this pretty highly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the height be shortened? I have a 10 inch bulkhead, so there is only 54 inches from the top of the stove to the top of the bulkhead. Can the hood be shortened to 24 -28 inches? The minimum from bottom of the hood to cooktop is 26 inches.\n Answer:","completion":" The hood comes in 2 pieces. So yes it can go down to 16 and up. Charidy Hope this helps\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do I install this into a cathedral ceiling?\n Answer:","completion":" The chimney top of the hood extends; however, I doubt it would reach to the top of a cathedral ceiling. I believe the specs show it will go to about 8' high. You could contact the company to see about purchasing additional chimney extensions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The accessory that it came, it had a screen plug with some pins on the other side.Can any one who ordered it to tell me what is that for?Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" It's the heat and smoke sensor\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this hard-wired or does it plug in?\n Answer:","completion":" It is plug in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there any way to set the clock to standard time?\n Answer:","completion":" No. It only displays military time.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit come with aluminum mesh or baffle filters?\n Answer:","completion":" Baffle filters\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do they hook up the refrigerator, the way technician from Sears installs?\n Answer:","completion":" You can request the delivery company to hook up for a fee. I hooked mine up myself. All it takes is a wall outlet and screwing the water hose to the wall and the fridge. Took me all of 5 minutes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why are the dimensions of this model different on this site than the LG site, Home Depot, and Lowes? I think this is a mistake.\n Answer:","completion":" Home depot is wrong from experience. Mine was correct on Amazon and LG when I purchased mine. I would go from typing the model number to the LG site and use manufacture specs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The depth is listed as 30-34 inches. This model is \"counter depth\" and is listed to have a depth of 24.13\" without handles on other sites??\n Answer:","completion":" I have the counter depth model. The body of the refridgerator is the same depth as my counters. The handles do protrude out in front. It is not enough to affect movement in my kitchen. The model with a depth of 30-34\" would stick out considerably from the counters. It is larger capacity though. It would probably work if one side of the fridge were against a wall.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there any way to get the doors to close tight? They pop back open and need to be manually closed. Had it checked out and the repairman couldn't see anything wrong, including the leveling.\n Answer:","completion":" Our installer told us the fridge had to be tipped slightly backwards to secure gravity assisted closure of the doors. Strictly level does not do it. Our installer was home depot who said they see this all the time. Our doors snap shut perfectly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: to confirm, the refrig will be delivered into the kitchen and debris removed?\n Answer:","completion":" you need to pay for installation to have every thing installed and old fridge removed\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this system filter gaillardia?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know and if you meant Giardia, I wouldn't trust it. I'd still boil the water from this filter for cooking and drink bottled water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Want this to remove lime and other minerals from our hard water, so my car doesn't have spots! Will it work for this purpose? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" This is a carbon filter to improve the taste of the water. If your water has high mineral content, you'll need a more comprehensive solution (water softener\/reverse osmosis - hard to say at this point). In my area, I would talk to a local irrigation supply house - they can connect you with someone to test your water. Once you have that test, they can point you toward a solution. The solution all depends on your budget. The least cost option - don't wash you car in sun and dry it off with a towel.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many gallons will the this filter filter?\n Answer:","completion":" Off the top of my head I think it said 11000. But obviously depends on how bad the water.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how does it attach to garden hose?\n Answer:","completion":" The filter is threaded on both ends. It's best to use quick connects to protect the plastic threads.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this item everpure h-300 compatible?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it is. This is the second Omnipure I have purchased. It seems to function the same as the Everpure H-300.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this item ELF5M-P compatible?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, KDF identifies a filtration media within the filter. You can look up KDF on the web for further information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I replaced my H300 filter with the Omnipure ELF-5M-KDF-P Carbon Block Filter, but I see particles floating that weren't there before. Is that normal?\n Answer:","completion":" They should eventually go away. Your h300 is a .25 micronfilter. The elf-5m-kdf-p is 5 micron, it will allow much larger particles through. If they are white it may be calcium. Harmless go nack to the h300 much better filter\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I also have a Hoshizaki 4HC-H large filter for my ice machine. Do sell these filters or another brand that would fit?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello, please copy and paste this link. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Compatible-9655-11-9326-11H-Replacement-BevGuard\/dp\/B00CUE0CPM\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378092048&sr=8-1&keywords=bgh3200s+pavel\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a body glove filter system in my restaurant that uses the body glove BG-3000S or BG-3000R &amp; ever pure H300 EV927200. Will this unit work?\n Answer:","completion":" Elf fits where H300 filter fits just fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it removable? I would like to use it in my rental kitchen.\n Answer:","completion":" The adhesive is pretty strong. If you were to try to remove this product, you would probably lift some of any underlying paint, depending on the quality and age of that paint. But, I don't think it would do any serious damage to the wall. I did a test piece on a wall with a decent paint job, and I was able to remove with no damage at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi. How are you? Can I put my refrigerator magnets on top of the film? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" Hello. No, the film is still only paper, with a stainless steel look and no magnetic qualities.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you use it on cabinets? Want to put it on old cabinets in heated garage\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would peel off. Actually I used mi no to cover shutter louvers and it wouldn't stay. I believe the film is best suited for metallic surfaces.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the satin stainless steel or the matte brushed nickel finish?\n Answer:","completion":" satin\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use it on a fridge with curved edges?\n Answer:","completion":" Depends on where the curves are. Mine has curves around the sides of the doors. And it did great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be used as a kitchen backsplash?\n Answer:","completion":" If your backsplash is a few feet long it can. Mine is a little over 9 feet and I scrapped this material for 18 gauge stainless steel because of the difficulty of managing this thin material. The additional cost of SS sheet is worth the effort and cost.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this be used on the front of a dishwasher?\n Answer:","completion":" I used it on my dishwasher. It worked pretty well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this on the front of an oven, too? Is it heat resistant?\n Answer:","completion":" I have put fairly hot items on my table without marringnor melting. I doubt that the front of an oven would get hot enough tp melt it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the vent considered to be a metal foil vent? Can't use a foil vent with my dryer, manu. suggests a heavy metal vent, which are a pain to maneuver.\n Answer:","completion":" The vent that comes with it is a metal foil vent. But you can attach it to a metal vent and attach the metal vent to your dryer. That's what we've done.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used for a gas dryer??\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure due to the possibility of gas fumes needing to escape\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there something online that says this product will meet code. My inspector is saying it does not meet code.\n Answer:","completion":" Well I'm not sure about that. They are not the best idea to use indoors as there will be moisture which can cause mold. I'm using it as a cheap outdoor vent. Sliding the hose and lint trap out my sliding door on the deck ouside. If you use it indoors be sure to wipe down the moisture left behind. And clean the lint trap after every use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there something online that I can print out from the manufacturer saying if meets code? My inspector is saying it won't.\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure, but I don't think it meets code. I had to beg to Ge the best buy guys to install my dryer with it.

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be mounted to the wall and can it be easily detached for cleaning\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it can. You need to drill a hole in the back in order to mount it on the wall, and obviously need enough clearance so you can add water to the base and clean the filter. Since all the lint gathers on the screen and then drops into the drawer below, this is what you need to be able to detach, not the whole unit. Although you did not ask, this is a wonderful product well worth the small investment. My previous dryer has a self-contained lint system, but my new one needed to be vented outside. I was afraid of animals getting in the venting, so I went to this model instead of outdoor venting. It has worked perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the width of the insert?\n Answer:","completion":" The width is 12\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The product dimensions are listed as 7 x 7 x 7 inches. Is this correct? If not, what are the actual dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" That is the outside dimension. It is not square but irregular to fit the dryer. It's perfect match to existing filter.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do you know if this is the proper replacement lint screen for a Whirlpool Duet Dryer Model No. WGD9470WW2?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not have a \"Whirlpool Duet Dryer. I suspect that my dryer is the same as the Whirlpool. Only one or two companies make drers and they wind up all over with different names. I purchased this lint screen for my dryer. It does the job. I do not feel that it is as well made but as I said, It does the job. John\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will the doors come off easily so we can fit it through a 30\" door?\n Answer:","completion":" The doors do come off. Not sure how easily as they were removed by the delivery company to get the fridge up a flight of stairs. They were put back on with ease. FYI - the handles also come off the doors if that is an option - then you might not have to remove the door. Best of luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just received mine and it seems to run a little loud...constantly humming...is this normal?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine is a different sounding fridge, but not really louder, I believe it is mostly fan noise not compressor noise. But ... make sure that you have at least 2\" of air gap in the back. It is such a big unit it is tempting to push it back as far as you can. The better air flow you have over the back the less sound you hear.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The CFE29TSDSS is supposed to have hot water capability but the description does not mention it - is this the correct model?\n Answer:","completion":" It does have hot water capability. 10 ounces @ 190F max. Not exactly ideal for black tea, but works for green tea, hot chocolate, and instant oatmeal. Mine is being delivered this week and I will post a review after I get a feel for it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The dimensions are not very clear in this ad. The space I have available for my fridge is 69.75\" h x 36\" w and 30\"d or deeper. Will this fridge fit?\n Answer:","completion":" The height dimensions are 69 and 7\/8, so you might be tight on the height aspect. It's also a very deep fridge, extending a couple of inches beyond my lower cabinets beside the fridge. Another thing that was problematic was the delivery. The fridge is so deep that it barely fit through the front door. It wasn't the fridge depth so much, but on the left fridge door, the ice maker button extends out about another inch exceeding the dimensions of our front door. Fortunately the guys that delivered it were pretty expert, and completely took off the fridge door to get it in the house.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the hot water dispenser lock to accidental prevent burns\n Answer:","completion":" It takes so long to heat the water that an accidental mishap is extremely unlikely. We never use the feature as it is much faster to microwave the cup of water than wait. I checked it out just to verify it works and no one has used it since. If you don't have a microwave than it is useful if you are a patient individual.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How long does it take to heat up the water in the hottest setting?\n Answer:","completion":" 5 1\/2 minutes. At first that felt like a long time. Now I love it - I simply occupy myself with something for that time and I am not microwaving my water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is width 36\"? I have opening is 36 1\/2\"\/ does it fit in?\n Answer:","completion":" If one side of the refrigerator is NOT adjacent to a wall, you should be ok.

{"prompt":"Question: One answer is that fridge has auto defrost and another answer states it has no freezer. I'm confused!\n Answer:","completion":" There is no freezer. However, the cooling tubing is vertical along the inner back wall and it is still possible that that could frost over. As an automatic feature, when the compressor cycles off, the frost melts, runoff is captured in a trough and drains through a hole at the base of the inner back wall to an evaporation tray below the compressor. Once you get your temp set to your satisfaction, just check every so often that the drain hole isn't plugged by debris or whatever.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: i need a quiet refrigerator because I have a very small space. Does it make ANY noise?\n Answer:","completion":" We have this in our bedroom. Yes, the fridge's compressor does make some noise, but not enough to bother us when we sleep.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many 12 ounce cans will it hold\n Answer:","completion":" It will hold eight 12 ounce cans in the door holder. We are using this in our visitor garage apartment. I keep the can holder full of 12 ounce cans in the door, a 2 liter bottle of a different soda in the door, there is room for a half dozen eggs in the door (I don't use this option), about 12-18 bottles of water (20 oz bottles), and random snacks.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this 220VAC version?\n Answer:","completion":" No it is not. Works on 110 and I might add that it was a great buy and works great. Use it in our 5 th wheel RV and delivers all of the ice that I need.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you use it all the time\n Answer:","completion":" I usually turn it off during the night but you don't have too. I just do it to unplug electrical items. It words really well. Small but makes lots of ice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone have a problem with the drain parts?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a hard time sometimes getting a hold on the drain to pull the plug but I relate it to the strength in my hands. Otherwise I don't have a problem. Hope that helps. Roxanne\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: anyone know how to clean it left it unplugged when we went away and came home to a mess only had it a short time... cant throw that money now what???\n Answer:","completion":" I read somewhere to use 50\/50 vinegar and water, run it few a cycle or two. HTH\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what kind of ice does it make? Looking for nugget ice, like Sonic restaurants\n Answer:","completion":" This would be perfect on size small setting\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it comparable to nugget ice (chewable ice) machine that you see in hospitals?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know about nugget ice, but the cubes are small like little light buds. I like it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will the fridge be installed for me? I do not know how to install one\n Answer:","completion":" When it was delivered, they unpacked, brought into house, and put where I wanted. I inspected it and signed for it. You will need to take off all the protective film on stainless (I recommend pulling it away then using a razor blade along the rubber part on door so it comes off clean). You will also have to put in drawers in fridge. The last thing is hook up the water line. All 3 of those are simple. The water line is as simple as screwing it on and turning water line on. You will have to put filter in. The only thing i did not do is put the brackets in wall so fridge doesnt tip. I am pretty sure you are safe from your fridge falling over.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this fridge actually 74 inches tall?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine measures 70-1\/4\" from the floor to the highest point at the hinges.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you lock the wheels\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if there is a way to lock the wheels. We did adjust the knobs by the wheels that levels it which now keeps it from rolling. Before that I couldn't open the door without pulling it out of its cubby. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you lock the wheels on cye23tsdss\n Answer:","completion":" It has legs that screw out and take the weight off the wheels, but I would NOT buy this Frig. It is very noise! You can hear the motor running all the time, and it has a couple speeds. Even when it is on the low speed you can hear it. When it is kicked on and running full strength you can hear it from 30 feet away. I even had GE come out to look at it a couple of times. This is such a comment complain (google it GE cafe and noise) that they developed a housing that goes around the motor, but I did not notice an improvement. So my advice is to get an LG or some other brand. My last frig was an LG and it was a 100 times better. Also the ice maker always gets clogged, requiring you remove the tray and fix the issue. The ice maker is also VERY slow. No chance it will provide more than 4 glasses in a night....which when you have company is easy to do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: In the precise fill option, can you walk away from the dispenser while it fills your cup or pitcher?\n Answer:","completion":" Nope, you have to engage the water dispenser (by pressing cup against it). It's also not especially precise. I'd say it's more of an estimate, often off by an ounce or two.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What warranty is provided with purchase?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe it was 1 year. I purchased an extended warranty\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with installation instructions?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Easy to install.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this part compatible with the Kitchenaid Dishwasher model #KUDK03CTSS2?\n Answer:","completion":" Stephanie, I am nearly positive that this is the right part. I'm no tech, I'm just a do it yourself guy... but that is pretty much THE balance kit that works for A LOT of their models... it's kind of universal. So much so that you can probably find it in-stock at any local appliance parts place.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We are installing the 8194001 door balance kit on our kitchenaid dishwasher &amp; it is screeching. where can we access the original guide mentioned?\n Answer:","completion":" Entire dishwasher must be withdrawn (at least partially) from the cabinet. The original guide is found near the door hinge. I reused the original guides and only used the cord cable. Bottom line is that it is a poor design and cheap only for the manufacturer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this also fit KitchenAid Model KUDP02CRBS1?\n Answer:","completion":" Most likely because dishwashers share the same parts but you need to verify on the KitchenAid website.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this replace the lg adq36006101 filter?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - According to manufacturers blurb it replaces \"This filter replaces all of the following filters: LG Filters - LT700P, ADQ36006101, ADQ36006101-S, ADQ36006101S, ADQ36006102, ADQ36006102-S, ADQ36006102S, 048231783705, ADQ36006101 and Sears\/Kenmore Filters - 9690, 46-9690, LT700P.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these replacements going to replace Kenmoreclear 46-9690?\n Answer:","completion":" In a word Yes. I use them in my Kenmore Elite refrigerator. It states on the filter box that it replaces 46-9690.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What contaminants does these filters reduce?\n Answer:","completion":" I wish that i could be of more help but without going to the manufacturer's information sheet (www.watersentinelfilters.com WSL-3) i can only help with what i know and am reading off the container. It does take the taste and smell of Chlorine from the water. I haven't noticed any any Sulfur smells and i know that it takes out some of the other hard particulates. Wish i could be of more help. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will the fridge still tell you when to replace the filter if you use this one?\n Answer:","completion":" yes. you reset it in the main display on the fridge door. the days are counted down through the main display not when the filter says it's no good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I've used these, but only get a couple weeks out of them before flow is REALLY slowed down. Anyone else have this problem? Is this typical?\n Answer:","completion":" I've had mine in for over a month and have noticed no decrease in pressure\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will these work for an LG model number LFX28968ST\n Answer:","completion":" You should check your fridge manual to see what water filter it needs. This filter works for the LG700P. I did a quick google search and it appears that the LG700P is the one for your fridge, but don't take mine or googles word for it, I would still check the manual before purchasing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these filters replace lg french 4 door refrigerator? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. The LG uses a standard, this fits them in that standard.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this water filter fit refridgerator Kenmore Model number 79571013010? Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" I can't answer that because I have a LG. I would email the seller.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the 3 pack water filters work in a Kenmore Elite, French doors frigerator, and is there free shipping?\n Answer:","completion":" Yep Dori...& free shipping w\/\"prime\" membership!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just bought this for an LG LFX28977ST and these are around 1\/3 the size. I thought it said it was a replacement for the original? Help!\n Answer:","completion":" I have a different model of LG and it was the same size - not sure if it is compatable or not with your model.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" Actual dimensions 23 5\/8 deep by 35 3\/4 wide at the glass and is adjustable hieght up to 9 ft ceiling. Should be mounted 28 to 29 inches from cook surface to underside of unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the minimal ceiling height supported? Keep in mind that the ceiling will need to drop by about 6\" to bring in the duct.\n Answer:","completion":" On the face of it, I'd say 8 feet. My ceiling was a tad less than 7 feet, so I cut the tower, and it works fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can unit be mounted directly to ceiling, which is vented?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes , ours is mounted to the ceiling which is vented.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the vent size to outside?\n Answer:","completion":" 6\"\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this fit a 7'6\" ceiling height?\n Answer:","completion":" The height is adjustable so should not be a problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: THe information does not say how many Sones (sound level) it is rated for. How loud or rattle-y is this?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think it's that loud . Its not whispering quite but not annoying loud either . It's nice and I feel well worth the price . .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it work on a 10\" ceiling?\n Answer:","completion":" It depends on how high off the cooktop you want the vent. With a standard height of a cooktop the vent would be 36\" to 40\" with a 10' ceiling. If that is too high, you could frame out an area above where you are going to install the vent and drop the height to 9' then you would be able to adjust the height of the vent accordingly. Since I installed this vent it has worked fantastic and looks awesome. It really clears the cooking odors out of the kitchen and I love the auto timer. It would be a good choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought this off amazon do I need to buy ducting to the outside or does it come with ducting for that?\n Answer:","completion":" it comes with extendable plastic ducting don't remember how long ( think 3-4 feet ) so i would hang on until i get it see if can do with that one, then measure how much you need if any.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: trying to install this unit (ductless) Pg 8 in the installation guid refers to a \"optional air diverter\" wher can i get this?\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't buy one. I only bought the filters from home depot and every thing is working very well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you change to fahrenheit? I see the hole on the back but I have no idea how to adjust it.\n Answer:","completion":" You need something very narrow to go in that hole.

{"prompt":"Question: does it use batteries\n Answer:","completion":" Dear friend, Yes,it is. Cindy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would I be able to turn this on for only a couple minutes on really gently cycle? My delicates are delicate!\n Answer:","completion":" I have not used for delicates, but I can say the machine has selection of a delicates cycle and you can choose soak only too. Soak setting stirs the water only a few times to mix the soap and water, then sits, maybe that would work too.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the unit vibrate a lot? Will my downstair neighbor hear the machine running? What is the noise level? 6 sones or more?\n Answer:","completion":" It was defective and I never got to use it. I bought it in June, and have yet to get a refund. The casters can't hold the weight and flatten out, and hoses are so cheap and thin they won't hold up. Mine came already damaged and was unusable. It also wasn't new, as there was black tape wrapped around the bottom of the hose to fix someone else's prior problem. The Haier 1.46 cf has much better hosing, is not noisey, cleans well, and I put good caster's where the leveling feet were and it's perfect.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does it do with noise level? Does it run quiet or does it make quite a bit of noise?\n Answer:","completion":" It runs really quietly in my opinion. It comes with an additional noise dampening plate hidden under the foam in the box. Sometimes the splashing water is the noisiest part of the wash. It doesn't vibrate if it it well balanced. Nice little washer with big capacity, kinda rough on the clothes though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: it wont drain!!! what is wrong with it??????????????????\n Answer:","completion":" Is the drain hose hanging I've the sink high enough? (Once you get it working, consider buying a lint trap to zip tie around the end of the drain hose. You'll be surprised at how much lint collects. Not the best for general plumbing.) Good luck!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: website for Sonya?\n Answer:","completion":" Its awesome for small family\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many articles of clothing. Cotton shirts and jeans or cotton pants does the unit hold per wash?\n Answer:","completion":" It did a pretty decent size load. It's pretty deep. However, the Avanti is better. Our Sonya broke early on, and dealing with their customer service was a huge pain. It took two months to get them to take the machine back and credit us.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: WHAT TYPE OF SOAP SHOULD I USE HE ?\n Answer:","completion":" We've asked around, and the recommendation we've received for machines of this type (the technology is called \"smart drum\") is to use detergent labeled \"High Efficiency\" or \"HE\". We've had excellent results with Tide Free & Gentle HE.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I don't have a sink right next to the laundry room. Can this washer be connected to the regular washer hook up rather than connect to sink n faucet?\n Answer:","completion":" I think that you may use a Y-connector--generally, those are intended for two garden hoses for homes. Such a Y-connector would have a valve for each side (H\/C). You may need to attach small hoses to the outlets in order to attach the Y-connector--perhaps conventional washing machine hoses.. People with other models have mentioned this solution, anyway.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit spin dry?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how does the water stop when washer is full\n Answer:","completion":" yes, There is a sensor to control the water level,it's automatic, so no worry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it loud? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" It is quite a bit louder than I expected. You would not want this in the same room where you watch television, for example.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it store Ice as well as make it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Once the ice is made it falls into a tray where the ice is stored. Since the unit is not a freezer, the ice may melt depending on ambient temperature. The good news is that if the ice melts the water is recycled and will be made into ice again.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the warranty period\n Answer:","completion":" The return time is 30 days for amazon and there is a 1 year warranty from the manufacturer. I'm going to send mine back. The water inside never freezes. That's not good for an ice-maker. Get it? Water + freeze = ice cubes. no freezo no ice cubes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are the cubes square and solid or are they hollow\n Answer:","completion":" The unit has two ice settings; small and large. The only difference between small and large is how hollow the pieces are. Large pieces are a square that is concave on one side. Small pieces are a square that is the same size but quite hollow. It will take a lot longer to make 'large' pieces than 'small' pieces. Also if the ambient temperature is too high where you have the ice maker, it might not even be possible to make 'large' pieces. The manual recommends 'small' unless the room is within a fairly tight temperature range.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it dual voltage (110-240 v)\n Answer:","completion":" Mine is 115VAC only. Doesn't draw much current. Rated at 2.7A.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Its a 110 v or 220\/240v?\n Answer:","completion":" 110v\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are the ice cubes clear\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how much ice does it hold, and do i need to run a water line to it, thanks\n Answer:","completion":" has plenty of ice, and no water line. I fill up to line with abt 3 small bottles of water and good to go. went through abt. 4 until I settled on thisone and it is absolutely great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many pounds of ready ice will it hold in its basket?\n Answer:","completion":" It has a rather small basket. This is an ice maker is not designed to \"store\" ice, since the basket area is not refrigerated. It makes about a gallon of good clear cubes in a couple of hours, but you need to monitor it and dump the ice basket into your freezer in a bag or we use our fridge ice make bin (ice maker doesn't work in fridge). When the unit runs during the day while we'll at work, most of the ice melts and then shuts off. When we get home, we just turn it back on and the ice starts pumping out. We have been very satisfied with this unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: help i need a manual plugged in added water 9 hours later still no ice\n Answer:","completion":" Manual says, conditions for ice making cycle are right but no ice is made....Call for service...626-912-9877, ext 107\/120, mon-fri 8am_5pm pdt email: info@maxi-magic.com. website : www.maxi-matic.com\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: IS the lid locking? Another model had a magnet - does this one? I want a washer without locking lid so I can let clothes soak.\n Answer:","completion":" The lid does not lock. you can open it anytime and the only thing that happens is the clothes stop spinning\/washing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a direct-drive motor or is it belt-driven?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not certain; however, upon removing the machine from its original box and packing material I was required to remove a metal bar which held the tub components in place during shipping... combine that with the machine having a high spin rpm rate, and is extremely quiet, my experience would lead me to favor a direct drive mechanism and not a belt driven system. We love the machine and are very pleased with it... it's even quieter than our clothes dryer!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How full does the washer get with the Deep Fill option? Water to the top of the drum?\n Answer:","completion":" Even on the deep fill, the water won't fill more than 3\/4 of the drum.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a feature or tweak or loophole that I can use on this machine to add more water to it if the deep fill option does not cover clothing?\n Answer:","completion":" no, deep fill is the highest water can (and should) go on this tub.. for us it wasn't a problem as we're coming from a 3.2cf and this is a 3.9cf so it's working well for us.. biggest thing we have is a Queen comforter and it washes it without a problem..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much water does this machine use on its lowest level GTWN5650FWS\n Answer:","completion":" I have given a link to to energy guide for this unit below. Further information can be obtained from the manufacturer. http:\/\/www.goedekers.com\/assets\/PDF\/GE\/gtwn5650fwsenergyguide.pdf\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: on the GTEN5650FWS 3.9 CU FT. can any one tell about washing King size bedding? I wash it in my old one just fine,but dont know what size it is.\n Answer:","completion":" It can wash a king bedspread or comforter, however, first want to make sure you follow the manufacturer of the comforter's washing directions. If it is machine washable, make certain you can put it in the washer without having to pack it in. It should fit loosely around the agitator. If you have to stuff it in, you do not want to wash it, as it will not get totally clean. I hope this helps. Thanks for checking!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Am thinking of buying the GE GTWN5650F. Can I use regular detergent if I am NOT going to use any of the HE features like eWash or PreciseFill?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it made in the USA?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: From other answers it appears as if the purchaser will need hoses. Where can these be purchased and why don't they come with the washer?\n Answer:","completion":" The hoses were inside the washer. I am sure yours will be also, just open it up.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does a normal wash cycle take?\n Answer:","completion":" It depends on load size, but an average size takes 44 minutes (plus fill time).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does everyone agree that this refrigerator is noisier than normal as some have stated in reviews or are these just isolated cases?\n Answer:","completion":" Check out Consumer Reports. They also said this is a great rerigerator except for the noise. The noise kept it from being the number one pick. BTW, we just got our new Samsung french door counter depth rerigerator. It is \"Whisper\" quiet. You have to actually listen to tell if it is running.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the height from the clusters to the top of the refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" From the floor to the top of the door hinge (highest point) is 70 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What space (W\/H\/D) shall be provided for installation of the GE PYE23kSDSS refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you for your interest in Goedeker's!

Thank you and have a great day! -Danielle at Goedeker's\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it true that light indicating \"change water filter\" has nothing to do with whether the filter needs to be changed or not - just a timer? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" From what was told to me from \"repairmen\" ...can push button next to green light, several times to reset ...light to green ....and definitely if the water tastes \"funny\", change filter. Manufacture recommendation is ...\"change every 6 months\"...but I personally am @ the 10-month \"mark\" and light is still green and water has no \"funny' taste ... I recommend have a new filter \"on hand\" ..just be proactive\/preventive ...\n"}

It looks the same and comes up when I search for 469330 in Amazon\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure, my refrigerator is a Whirlpool side by side and W10295370A is the model listed in the users guide. If you don't have a users guide, you can look for one on line under the manufacturers name.\n"}

Are they the same?\n Answer:","completion":" It's whirlpool, but the one I've ordered had the same number that it's listed under and one I needed. My refrigerator is the WRT771RWYM whirlpool top freezer and it has interior water filter. Regardless, I wouldn't really suggest ordering here. I ordered from here and after running a couple gallons like normal to clean it it still came out with a really disgusting taste. I ran it even more then tried it same thing.

{"prompt":"Question: Is there a way to add water while it spins, essentially using it to rinse out the clothes before eventually spin drying them?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Once you close the lid, the motor starts. This machine is mainly meant for extracting water, not rinsing. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it heat the clothes as it spins?\n Answer:","completion":" This device does not heat the clothes. Centrifugal force is generated by the spinning-expelling most of the moisture.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this spin dryer compare to the mini dryer in size?\n Answer:","completion":" The best answer I can give you is a comparison, since I own both. I stand about 6'2\" around 200 lbs, but enough about me. I take a regular pair of Wrangler jeans and barely fit them into the mini dryer. With the Nina Soft Spin I can take two pair of jeans, with a little room left to possibly put in another pair. Then again if you were asking about the height and width; the footprint on the Nina is about 3\" bigger in diameter while it is about 6\" taller and spins a lot faster than the Mini.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this plug into a regular outlet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - just a regular plug\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall is it?\n Answer:","completion":" Dimensions are listed as 14\"x14\"x24\"...so 24\" tall.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Have been saving up Amazon points to buy one and now unavailable? Mr. Tournet, please, please tell me this is only temporary.\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, they were only out of stock for a brief time, they are in stock now and for the foreseeable future. We try very hard to keep products in stock at all times, once in a while if sales are much higher than expected we run out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you still need to line dry clothes? how dry do they come out? lol, will it remove cat hair from the clothes?\n Answer:","completion":" Clothes come out just slightly damp. I usually hang shirts on a hanger or use a portable dryer stand. Clothing does not drip, and items are ready to wear in a few hours. No, the spin dryer does not remove pet hair or lint, only water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this dryer be good for hand washed cashmere sweaters? ( Cashmere fibers become very fragile when wet so if it tumbles it might not be very good for the sweaters.)\n Answer:","completion":" When I can wash sweat shirts and sweat pants in my Wonder Washer then transfer them to my Nina Soft Spin Dryer, spin for approximately 3 to 5 minutes and the clothes are almost dry, I'd say that the centrifugal force would be to much for cashmere. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Approximately how long does it take clothes to air dry after spinning? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" cant answer for clothes as I just use it for felt, but in a very short time, since all the water has been removed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Laundry Alternative has this Nina Soft Spin Dryer with 1800 rpm and another spin dryer with 3200 rpm and the latter holds a little more. Can anyone give me any info comparing the two? I don't know which would be better.\n Answer:","completion":" At the time I bought it, there was a spinner that had a higher RPM. I contacted the company and they said they were discontinuing it due to mechanical issues. I went ahead and bought this one and was reasonably happy with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be safe to put in a room as a personal fridge?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is. The only thing is the compressor has a slight hum when it runs. It's cold and very convenient to have by the bed\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how tall is this refrigerator?( Moses)\n Answer:","completion":" I have the larger model. All I can say is that the Amazon website had accurate specs for my model and the specs for the 3.3 size are on the website as well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be an outdoor refrigerator\n Answer:","completion":" I have it inside. But I guess if you have it under an overhang you should be fine\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you put this fridge in a built in cabinet\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, although you probably want to ventilate it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the temp range?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure precise temps but, you can set it low enough to freeze food in certain spots. I would say normal range for any regular refridgerator\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Dimensions: what is the width, depth, hight in inches\n Answer:","completion":" Here is the information you were inquiring about 17.7 x 18.5 x 32.8 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The description for the washer says 5.1 Cu. Ft but the model WM8000HVA on LG's website says it is 5.2 Cu. Ft. Which is correct?\n Answer:","completion":" All of the documentation that came with the washer says 5.2 Cu. Ft.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this come with the cables and hoses?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine came with hoses and a power cord for the washer but not the dryer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this washer\/dryer combo compatible with gas hookups?\n Answer:","completion":" This is the electric version, but the gas version should be available soon.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: dimensions\n Answer:","completion":" Do you mean the over all dimensions outside? 29\" x 40 4\/5\" x 32 3\/10\". The dimensions for the washer and dry are pretty much the same. The washer weighs about 227 lbs and the dry weighs about 158 lbs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you actually wash and dry a king size comforter in this set? we've yet to find a set that does no matter how big the capacity\n Answer:","completion":" yes. We have washed king comforters AND sheet sets together. The washer has no problem with it, and the dryer is phenomenal. This pair is the best on the market. Worth the money. Quick, efficient, quiet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to know the height without the pedastals, and do I have to buy the pedastals?\n Answer:","completion":" They are right at 41\" tall without pedestals. The Amazon item I purchased included the pedestals but the units themselves can be purchased without pedestals. It would depend on supplier as to how they group it. The 4 pc set with free delivery from Amazon was cheaper than just buying washer and dryer from local retailers\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have the stinky smell that other front load washers have?\n Answer:","completion":" Most of the Front Load Washers have stinky smell. Users need to perform maintenance twice a year with simple clean up. There is a bigger problem with reliability because they break down often, including the expensive front load washer and dryer. Check out before you make a major purchase.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The title heading says these are in graphite but the product description says they are in white, which is it please?\n Answer:","completion":" The ones I received are graphite and GORGEOUS\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The title heading says these are in graphite but the product description says they are in white, which is it please?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Lynne. The machines we bought are definitely in graphite. I've never seen them in white, but I suppose one might find them. Terrific machines, by the way.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there 2 kinds of this filter? the blue as shown in this website and the purple filter from other sellers. the purple filter makes water taste bad\n Answer:","completion":" No. Only use the blue ones. They are made by Whirlpool. It says you can use it on Kitchen Aid, Maytag, Amana and Jenn-Air.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The blue, not the purple are the real ones, right? Also, the labels of the purple misspelled \"Disposable\" as \"Disopsable\"\n Answer:","completion":" The ones I got were the blue ones and I couldn't find \"disposable\" misspelled. These were PUR filters. These filters were just like the original that came in my refrigerator.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these new filters in sealed boxes?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. ...must discord few glasses of water some sort of oily substance. Than work fine\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between W10295370 FILTER 1 and W102953570A?\n Answer:","completion":" Color and leaks. The non-translucent, these ones, leak.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i ordered this filter ( blue )that is shown in the website but i received a looks like replica purple filter. Is this generic brand?\n Answer:","completion":" Purple is what I received, although the picture on the box is blue. Says Whirlpool and fits 5 brands. I didn't care about the color.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many gallons we should drain before using it?\n Answer:","completion":" 1 gallon\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this fit Kenmore Elite refrigerators?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think so. We have a whirlpool gold.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this work?From photos it looks like it locks the front \"door\" to the side of the frig,how does this keep the 2 front doors from being opened?\n Answer:","completion":" You mean if you have a side by side fridge and freezer? You could lock one to the other. Put one on the freezer door and one on the fridge door and lock them together. It attaches with adhesive and it's strong.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How big are the holes? If I have to provide the padlock, I need to know if it will only take 1\/8\" shackle or 1\/4\" or smaller?\n Answer:","completion":" Either or will fit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how would this work for standard fride &amp; freezerdoors top &amp; bottom would you need 2 set;s\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, 2 sets will completely lock the doors\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be used on wood door\/cabinet? Will it stick well on wood material?\n Answer:","completion":" I assume it would stick just fine but if not buy some E6000 glue from Dollar General or welder glue from Wal-Mart and it will never come off I promise you!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the 2 different shaft lengths?\n Answer:","completion":" There's both about 8inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need a fridge lock to deter burglars. Are the square plates that atatch\/stick to the refrigerator metal or plastic?\n Answer:","completion":" It didn't work to deter my teenagers, as they pulled hard and the \"foam\" padding ripped away from backing. That said, I had a \"lock\" on there that doesn't really look like a lock and they weren't paying attention and just grabber and yanked the door as usual (the door sticks, so we all used to giving it a good strong pull to open it under normal conditions). But to deter burglars?....just depends on how determined in burglars is. All they'd need to do is slip a sharp, thin knife between the metal piece and the door and cut the foam backing. Would I risk 1000s of dollars of food if I was using this on a restaurant fridge? No, I wouldn't, I'd figure out how to get some holes of some sort drilled into the fridge instead. Hope that helps! Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where does the water come in on the back of this unit? We were trying to prep the area for the water and didn't know where do put the water lines :o)\n Answer:","completion":" Back\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this refrigerator also filter the water used for ice and sparkling\/still dispensers? If so what kind of filtration?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, it uses a Samsung DA29-00020B\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the freezer just one giant bin divided into two or does it have a rolling out top drawer for smaller items as well?\n Answer:","completion":" It has another bin thing that slides back to get to then other big one ! It's a great fridge\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What shape\/size are the ice cubes?\n Answer:","completion":" The ice cubes are half-circles, maybe about the size of two Tootsie Rolls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it possible to split the invoice in two? i am from Venezuela, and my currier can not import any product above 2000 $\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you get the Ice out of the bin?\n Answer:","completion":" Open the refrigerator the ice bin is on the top left if you look at the bottom corner you will find a button push that button and pull on the front of the ice bin. It will pop out\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you switch between sparking and still water \"on the fly\"? Or do you have to empty the sparkling water tank before still water will come out?\n Answer:","completion":" Sparkling water and regular water use separate buttons, which you can separately use on the fly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How is the water pressure from the standard (non-carbonated) dispenser? I have this fridge and it seems to take forever to fill a cup of water.\n Answer:","completion":" Mine works great. Fills as fast or a little faster than my sub zero did. Might be your pressure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the sparkling water require SodaStream-branded CO2 canisters, or can it use a bulk CO2 canister like the ones used in food\/drink service? If it requires SS items, where does the canister go?\n Answer:","completion":" It's constructed to require Sodstream 60L CO2 canisters. If you buy the refrigerator, Samsung will give you a $30 rebate off of a Sodastream canister; thereafter, you can exchange the canister at many places for $15. There's also a company that makes a converter that supposedly enables you to use standard CO2 canisters with this fridge.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use Soda Stream sparkling drink mixes with the sparkling water? The Soda Stream soda or the fruit drink mixes?\n Answer:","completion":" You can put anything you want in the sparkling water. That said, as others have mentioned, the sparkling water isn't nearly as carbonated as the sparkling water that's included in soda such as Coke, 7-Up, etc. So, this sparkling water dispenser isn't a great alternative to soda pop. Also, because the sparkling water isn't heavily carbonated, I personally don't like adding the soda mixes, because they just make the water taste like *flat* soda pop.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this Bosch model SHX46A05UC\/14?\n Answer:","completion":" Good afternoon, Unfortunately we do not carry the required part is our stock. Kind Regards, Customer Services Spares4Appliances\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this part fit Bosch model SHV99A13UC\/31?\n Answer:","completion":" Good afternoon, Thank you for your enquiry. I'm very sorry but we do not carry the correct part that you require. If you have any other queries, please feel free to contact us Kind regards, Annie\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit a Bosch SHU5306UC-U12? It is non-vented through the dispenser.\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, The correct part for your appliance is 490467 Kind regards S4A\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, does it have a non-return air flap?Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It's noisy when air moves through with the unit off, when it's windy outside. It's probably best to use an outside vent cover that has a good built in flap.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the overall width 30\" from one side of the glass to the other? or is it just the metal under the glass that is 30\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Glass is 30\" from side to side.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can't figure out how to set the clock? Anyone have instructions? Tried the obviousness, but can't get it to work.\n Answer:","completion":" I set it once based on the instruction set (which I don't have anymore). I think you have to press and hold one of the buttons for a few seconds to set the minutes and press again to set the seconds. Not sure which button though. Good luck. My clock ran 5 minutes fast everyday so I've just ignored it since then.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a sloped kitchen ceiling that is about 8' 9\" above the hood area. Can I get an additional extension piece?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, they will sell you an additional extension...I called to order because I couldn't find online\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a ductless option for installation?\n Answer:","completion":" Ductless was not part of the package, we had to call the manufacturer for that option after we purchased it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How are the lights and what type of bulbs are they\n Answer:","completion":" The lights are LED and they are very nice. We are very happy with the range hood. It is modern, bright and has a great fan. I did not find it noisy even on high speed. The hood makes our white mosaic glass and white cabinet kitchen sparkle. We used Bianco Antico granite and all stainless appliances. I don't have a picture handy, but it came out beautiful\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the legs be removed, what's the overall height (including the hinge) after removing the legs? My bar counter can only fit 20.5\" tall wine chillers\n Answer:","completion":" My unit is full at this time, and I'm unable to move it enough to see if the legs are removable, but they're adjustable for leveling, so there's a possibility they can be removed. That being said, if the legs come off, there's a metal plate on the bottom (aprox 1\/4\" thick) and the hardware for the door's hinge. The leg on that side is a different size to accommodate the hinge. Without legs you would still need a platform on the bottom for balance(?) As it sets on the counter the unit measures 21 1\/8\" to the top, and 22\" including the hinge. It's a great unit, and a very good value, I hope it works out for you!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it true that it is completely vibration free?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I find it very quiet and vibration free since it has no compressor. When the house is very quiet I can barely hear it cycle on.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit have a lock?\n Answer:","completion":" It does not have a lock\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I put this in a large closet (under stairs) will it cause the closet to get warm, as it dissipates heat? Anyone noticed?\n Answer:","completion":" I have mine under a desk in the kitchen with 4\" clearance on all sides. There is no apparent heat coming off the unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hot in Texas. Weather can drop electricity, but comes up. Will the cooler go back up by itself? Hope by itself a reasonable cooler.\n Answer:","completion":" I take your question to be \"does the cooler restart after a power failure\" -- to which the answer is \"yes\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: when the power goes out does this unit power back up or does it stay off\n Answer:","completion":" When the power comes back on so does the unit. It doesn't have a backup power supply.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone please give me the INSIDE dimensions? I would be using it for cigar storage and need to make sure my spanish cedar trays fit easily. Thanx\n Answer:","completion":" The inside dimensions are basically a \"box\" that safely measures 13\" x 13\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the vertical length of the door, it's height from the floor and the hinges additional height?\n Answer:","completion":" It is 22 inches from the floor including the hinges.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does the description say is is 20 cu ft?? Isn't is more like 3 Cu Ft? If it were 2' by 2' and 5 1\/2 - 6' tall I'd 20 Cu Ft. Is this a TARDIS?\n Answer:","completion":" My guess is that whoever entered the specs saw \"capacity\" and entered \"20\" meaning *bottles* without noticing the units.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it safe to keep this unit on a carpeted floor?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It is on my carpet floor and seems to be perfectly fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need to buy the power plug separately for this appliance\n Answer:","completion":" Viviane, this model comes with a junction box and cord that will run from the unit to your electrical wiring. The only thing you might need is more electrical line if the junction box is unable to reach your wiring connection.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I have a dishwasher already will this one hook up the same way?\n Answer:","completion":" My plumber make the connection but he did not report any problems from replacing the old one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How well does this dishwasher dry with no heating element and just the hot water rinse?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't noticed any difference from my previous (Bosch and Asko), but usually run at night and unload in AM.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how loud is this washer?\n Answer:","completion":" compared to maytag I can barely tell the disher is on.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the racks stainless steel or plastic coated metal?\n Answer:","completion":" Plastic coated metal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is an installation kit required for this model?\n Answer:","completion":" No it doesn't need a kit. It comes with everything you should need. I had to move my electrical supply from the back wall where the dishwasher slides in to the left hand side outside the dishwasher space. I placed mine was under the kitchen sink, will work on either side. If you didn't already have a dishwasher you may need the Y piece to attach the dishwasher drain to the exhisting sink drain.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the \"reset\" or \"off\" button cancel and drain the dishwasher when it's running?\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you for your interest in Goedeker's! There is a small series of buttons that you can use to cancel and drain the dishwasher while running. The series is discussed in the accompanying user manual.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are the leaks prevented by the AquaStop system the kind most often responsible for hardwood floor damage?\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you for your interest in Goedeker's! The AquaStop system will isolate and stop leaks as the water is coming into the dishwasher. This is one of the most common causes of water damage to floors. There is an upgraded system on the high-end models called AquaStop Plus which also stops leaks during drainage. If you have any other questions, please feel free to call me at 1-888-768-1710. Thank you and have a great day! -Danielle at Goedeker's\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the Bosch dishwasher have a garbage grinder built in or just a filter ?\n Answer:","completion":" Filter I think. Works fine for our family. No problems as we have a Golden Retriever for pre-wash.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the cycle time? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Sort of a long answer. There are five cycles to choose from, and once you choose a cycle you can also choose from four options (but you don't have to choose an option). Here are the cycle times: a) Heavy - 2:15, b) Auto - 2:09, c) Normal - 2:15, d) Express - 0:30, and e) Rinse - 0:09. If you choose one of the options, these are the cycle times (based on choosing the Normal cycle): a) Half load - 1:39, b) Delicate - 1:28, c) Sanitize - 1:48, and d) Extra Shine - 2:08. I usually use the Auto cycle with no option selected. Keep in mind that unless you wait until right before you need your dishes to wash them, the long cycle time isn't really an issue because the machine is so quiet that you can't even tell it's running. I've had mine for three months now and would absolutely buy it again. In three months, I've only had to rewash a dish perhaps twice - and it was a dish with stuck on food. Glasses come out sparkly. And I've found that using liquid Cascade instead of Finish gel packs gets the dishes just as clean (the liquid stuff is less expensive). Just make sure you use Jet Dry liquid (NOT the solid that hangs in a basket - that stuff is horrible) - it does make a difference. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What items are included with this? Power cord, connections, drainage hose, silverware basket? What's in the box?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, I ordered this dishwasher and it came with all that is needed to install. It did not have a power cord though since it is intended to be wired directly to an existing circuit the way most larger appliances are. It does have a pretty long drain hose that is intended to be connected to your waste water line. In my case, I was replacing an older model with this one and it was quite easy since all I had to do was remove the old one and put this one in the same spot using the already existing electric, water and drain. Mine came with a siverware basket but we don't use it. Instead we put the silverware on the third rack, which is a shallow rack at the top of the washer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this unit heat water or is it only the temp of our house hot water?\n Answer:","completion":" It does have a water heater.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it quite\n Answer:","completion":" It is very QUIET.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this include all parts for a standard installation? Like water and power connectors, water lines, and cabinet mounts.\n Answer:","completion":" It does come with \"flanges\" that screw in to the side of the neighboring cabinets to mount the unit. It also has the pigtail for the electric - you will need to have an existing electrical box with a live connection available to connect the pigtail to. It had all the basic water line and drain connections. Unless you need a special adapter for a disposal you should be fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will I need to pre-rinse dishes in the sink before putting them in this dishwasher, or can I skip that step? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" I only scrape large amounts of food off, I don't rinse. If I don't have a full load for a day, I use the rinse cycle in the DW. This DW does a great job without pre rinsing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it beep at the end when it is done? (I have an older one that does and it will wake me up)\n Answer:","completion":" It's a user selectable option. To program it (from the owner's manual): Cycle Completion Signal (hidden controls only) 1 Open the door and press the [On\/Off] button. 2 Hold down the \"A\" button (see page 16) and press [Start] until the display indicates \"d:00\". Release both buttons. 3 Press the \"A\" button until the display shows \"b:02\". 4 Press the \"C\" button to increase or decrease the tone \"b:00\" = OFF and \"b:03\" = LOUDEST and press [Start] to save setting and close the door.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has Bosch addressed the plastic chrome handle trim breakage?\n Answer:","completion":" Haven't had a problem with the handle. I see the trim is plastic. Frankly I would avoid this dishwasher if I was you. We're trying to return ours or get a credit or something. Probably won't happen. We will sell it on Craig's list and buy an American model of some brand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What does it mean to be \"Fully integrated\" (versus the others that are \"partial\")?\n Answer:","completion":" The dishwasher fits under the counter and between cabinets, so that it is flush with the front of the cabinets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: looking of a griddle for my gas range center oval burner . will this work?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a ceramic stove, not gas, and it works fine on that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The information on the 6325 said it is constructed of cast aluminum. Aluminum does not work on induction cook tops as it is not magnetic. How than can it work?\n Answer:","completion":" It has a round steel embossed plate on the bottom which will react to the magnetic induction stove top. However, I returned mine due to the fact it would only get hot in the center. So I bought a 12 and a 1\/2 inch T-Fal induction skillet and LOVE IT. The entire bottom is steel which cooks more evenly. I hope this helped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work on the Samsung induction flexzone stove top?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, This product works on any cooktop.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it heavy?\n Answer:","completion":" NO, The product only weights 3lbs. 8oz. Specifications* Material: die-cast aluminum, Xylan nonstick cooking surface, silicone * Model: 6325 * Overall Size: 15\"L (19\" with handles) x 11 1\/4\"W * Cooking area: 12 1\/2\"L x 9 1\/2\"W * Base: 9\" Dia. * Weight: 3 lb. 8 oz. * Made in China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this TRULY work on an Induction cooktop?\n Answer:","completion":" It will work on a single burner but not well. It will only heat in the middle where the induction disc is. It will not heat evenly. Since there is a round disc, it will not work on a bridge element. The disc on the one I received had sharp edges and scratched my cooktop. I finally found one that works on my bridge element but since I didn't get it from Amazon not sure if I am allowed to say.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Same issue with 2 of these ovens. Lower oven reads the temp I've set it to but 3 diff therms. show it goes way up, then way down. Pls help!\n Answer:","completion":" We are not having that problem, but then again we normally only one of the two ovens and hardly ever use both at the same time. I would think when using both then that may alter the temps due to the voltage being pulled. Wiring may not be thick enough to handle the voltage draw. Sorry I couldn't give you a (for sure) answer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this stove require 30 or 60 amp plug I've been reading that some of the newer stoves need the higher amperage\n Answer:","completion":" Just standard 30 amp plug\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: We use a hand held steamer on present glass top. Do you think it would be okay to use on this surface?\n Answer:","completion":" I have not used a steamer but the pad and cleaner which came with the stove worked great. Even some dried food spillage came off and the stove top looks like brand new.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there any truth to the rumor that you can NOT use aluminum foil in the ovens on this range?\n Answer:","completion":" The manual says don't line the bottom or walls with foil or let foil touch the heating coil or temperature probe. But you can cover a dish with foil and that kind of thing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Love this oven, anyone having trouble with the plug getting in the way of pushing it all the way back against the wall? Looking for some tips\n Answer:","completion":" Two potential solutions: 1. Have an electrician hook it up directly, bypassing the outlet 2. Buy a pivoting outlet that plugs into the wall outlet and allows to connect the oven plug from the side\n"}

Most are these days, just look for the \"he\" on the bottle of both detergent and Softner\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there detailed instructions on how to hook up the washer and dryer? Are they easy to install?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Easy to follow step by step instructions. These machines have some shipping material to unpack but I installed both of mine in about 2 hours. I only needed help with lifting them on the pedestals. I am super happy with these machines.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this dishwasher come with all the required hoses etc for installation or do i need to order an additional product.\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with a water supply line as well as a drain hose. They aren't particularly long, though. If you are directly adjacent to the sink, it will be fine. For mine, it went through 2 cabinets and so I had to add extensions to both. I would guess the hoses are 5-6 feet long. I would recommend you google the install manual and take a look at that. The electrical hookup is via a junction box, so you need to make sure you have room and accommodations for that. This is by far the best dishwasher I've ever owned, by the way. So amazing having a dishwasher that will clean the dishes pretty much no matter what you throw at it, without prewashing. I just knock off the big stuff and it takes care of the rest every time. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is semi integrated?\n Answer:","completion":" Jim, a semi integrated dishwasher is partially hidden by a custom panel to blend in with your surrounding cabinets. Unlike a fully integrated unit, the controls will be visible above the panel instead of completely hidden.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: whats the difference between the 500 and 800 series?\n Answer:","completion":" James, one of the biggest differences is the noise level.

{"prompt":"Question: Will I need to pre-rinse dishes in the sink before putting them in this dishwasher, or can I skip that step? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Pre-rinse seriously. This unit has no food grinder internal but it has a filter to catch solid particulate. Of course, once that filter gets clogged you've got a mini-plumbing job on your hands. So rinse thoroughly. Water soluble stuff like cake frosting, ketchup, salad dressing, etc. can go in the dishwasher, but pieces of pasta or meat for example will cause you problems eventually.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the stainless steel finish coated\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the tub lining material?\n Answer:","completion":" This model has a stainless steel interior.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Any Fiestaware owners care to say whether the dishes fit? I see a lot of complaints about the tight fit of the plates.\n Answer:","completion":" All of our bowls and dishes are Fiestaware and they fit without problems. The racks allow you to orient the dishes either in rows or columns or combination of both. Bowls take up more space, but you can put them in either the bottom or top rack. Since the racks are wire, they can bend and flex to give you a bit more room. I wouldn't worry about space issues with this dishwasher. It is very roomy and it never ceases to amaze me how much more capacity it has than our previous dishwasher. You can dramatically increase the space by moving the drawer racks up and down or removing the utensil basket. I wouldn't hesitate for a second on this purchase. It's quiet, roomy and dependable. If you think the price is high, consider its resale value. Bosch dishwashers are highly desirable and are often snapped up quickly on classifieds. WHen I purchased it, my old dishwasher sat in the garage for months. I couldn't give it away and had to bribe a delivery person to haul it away.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: long lasting with daily use?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know but will find out. This is my first Bosch. I have had it less than a year but very happy with it. However, a friend of mine still has a Bosch dishwasher after 15 years with no issues.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it necessary to use the Finish brand soap &amp; drying agent for the Bosch dishwashers?\n Answer:","completion":" No, you can use whatever you would like. I prefer and use the Cascade soft pack ones.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with LP conversion orifices?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the ovens electric or gas?\n Answer:","completion":" The oven is gas\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this include installation and removing old oven\n Answer:","completion":" No. The appliance comes in a box. They did bring it directly into the kitchen and offered to unpack it. You'll need to buy a larger 5\/8 inch flex flex gas connector for both oven use if you can (most are 1\/2 inch, which will work). Install was easy and stove is super easy to operate. We love it!! Also, we put our old stove on front lawn strip and it was gone in two hours!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have to be a 5\/8 connection hose? It seems like the 3\/4 size would be better, provide more gas, and it is what my old stove has.\n Answer:","completion":" It is a 5\/8 connection to the stove so the supply is reduced no matter how big the hose is. Don't believe it will make a differnce\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used the Easy Clean feature? I'm wondering if it's just a gimmick.\n Answer:","completion":" Works ok but you have to use it as soon as u make a mess.we cookd a pizza in the top and some stuff fell off and burned on the bottom of the inside. Using the easy clean feature i was slowly able to remove moat of it. It did require a lot of elbow grease.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you ship to the big island Hi.\n Answer:","completion":" We have looked into it and it was extremely expensive. What we have done in the past is ship to a freight forwarder in California and then you would be responsible for it from there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you replace the center grill with a griddle? Is one included or is it an accessory you buy separately?\n Answer:","completion":" The griddle comes with the oven. You just place it on top in the center and it fits in that space. It works very well!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the height including the back part with the oven controls?\n Answer:","completion":" I just measured it. The front is 36\" high. The back is a little less than 47\" high. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the Stainless Steel easy to clean? Does it show lots of finger prints?\n Answer:","completion":" We haven't had any problems with fingerprints and it's easy to clean with stainless steel polish.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Our current range is set into the floor approximately 1\/2 inch. (Tile laid after the oven was put in place.) Will this impact the use of the bottom oven?\n Answer:","completion":" The range does have legs that you can adjust that should make up the 1\/2 difference that you have and be able to open bottom oven .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much clothes can it hold?\n Answer:","completion":" The Sonya compact holds full load 5 jeans 2 towels and 3 shirts all women plus size clothing. Excellent product. I highly recommend this washer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this washer come with 2 water hoses (hot and cold) or 1, I only have one faucet for hot and cold water how would this work? Tks\n Answer:","completion":" It does come with two hoses but we capped the hot side and only used the cold side and control water temp by faucet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used with a normal washer hose hookup?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! We had a previous washer and that was one of my concerns! And guess what? My original hose hookup just work fine! No need to adapt a different hose! So far this washer is a great buy!!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Dimension of this machine\n Answer:","completion":" This machine is 21\" wide, 21\" deep and 36\" tall, so NOT 36 x 21 x 21. I couldn't figure out why it was 36\" wide; width is ALWAYS the first measurement, NOT the height!! I almost didn't buy this machine because it wouldn't fit, THEN I finally saw THEIR specifications.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall is the unit with the door opened?\n Answer:","completion":" About 4.5 feet\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it use a lot of electricity? I'm afraid the electric is going to go sky high and my cost savings will be null.\n Answer:","completion":" Very little no where near as much as a regular washer. I run it on my boat using a little 12 volt to 120 volt inverter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it sing at the end of a cycle?\n Answer:","completion":" It beeps about 8 or 10 times once it finishes the final spin cycle. Its a good volume, I can hear it two rooms away. I've had mine for a few months now and I'm very happy with the purchase.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Bad smell from the washer? I was told to use bleach and hot water and let it turn for a whole cycle, can I do that?\n Answer:","completion":" Run a small load of hot water with no clothes. Add a cup of half baking soda and half distilled white vinegar to the load. If this seems to have an effect but the smell still lingers, do the same with a cup of bleach instead of vinegar and baking soda. Run a final load of just hot water. After the load, leave the machine's door open and allow the washer to dry completely. These remedies clean the buildup of dirt, detergent and water residue that collect in the drum, which emits a musty odor easily mistaken for sewage. Do this occasionally (every 3 or 4 months depend on how often you use your washer) Always leave the cover nearly open after each use to let the air circulate to remove water in the drain when you are not using the washer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the washer shake and vibrate to the level that a full size washer does? I'm in an apartment above another unit and can't have much vibration.\n Answer:","completion":" No vibration at all. It is so quiet, I forget that I'm doing laundry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how high with door up but folded? How tall with out wheels.\n Answer:","completion":" 43 inches and half. 33 without the wheels.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the price include the pedestals that are pictured?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the pedestals are an extra cost\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I hear front loads can take up to an hour to wash a load. What is the wash time for a normal wash?\n Answer:","completion":" Just depends.....there are different settings. Bummer is that you have to clean it periodically. Regardless of the kind, we were very displeased and frustrated with LG customer service. Our LG was leaking after 3 weeks and their customer service was a complete joke. After dealing with them for a month, Lowe's finally stepped in and replaced it for us since LG wouldn't\/couldn't fix it and it was just plain ridiculous that we were dealing with such terrible service, particularly when it was only 3 weeks old. I will never purchase an LG anything!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can I change the washer door to open from the otherside\n Answer:","completion":" The door is NOT reverseable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the washer door interchangeable\n Answer:","completion":" The door on the dryer can be reversed, but not the door on the washer. However, you may be able to purchase a washer with a door that opens on the left instead of the right.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the vent on the dryer (DLEX8000W) centered in the lower back of the dryer, or is the vent to one side or the other?\n Answer:","completion":" The best I remember, it is on the back, but can be vented on the right or left side by utilizing a knockout panel and reaching in and attaching you vent pipe through the side. Mine is vented on the right, so I am sure it can be vented from the back or the right side.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do they come with a stackable feature?\n Answer:","completion":" All LG Front Loading washers are stackable. You do have to buy the stacking kit separately.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the price include the installation?\n Answer:","completion":" No. They drop off inside the front door\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the latest model for both the washer and dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" YES\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: do these come with a standard warranty besides the one available for purchase?\n Answer:","completion":" This unit comes with a one year full warranty from the manufacturer. We do offer extended protection plans of 2 and 4 years.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The desc says 32 3\/10\" Deep. Is this for both of them? How much space do I need for plumbing behind them?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they are the same depth. You will need an additional 4-5 inches behind them for hoses and venting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are these pedestal?\n Answer:","completion":" no they are not you need to get does separate\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the washer and dryer come with each of its own pedestal\/drawer?\n Answer:","completion":" No, you must order seperately.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this front load washer have the typical problem of water and moisture sitting in the front seal causing smell and possibly mold?\n Answer:","completion":" The short anwser to your question is yes, but I beleive thats an unavoidable problem no matter what washer you buy. What we do is after washing we leave the washer door open just a crack so that it can dry out and you will not have a problem with mold or smells then.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does the description NOT inform buyers that they will have to cut and strip wiring so this can be spliced into the range?\n Answer:","completion":" I assumed cutting the wires would be required. Looking at the typical application before deciding to replace the socket would indicate cutting the wires could be required. Looking at the wire nuts supplied would also be a clue.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit a whirlpool front loader WFW9400su01\n Answer:","completion":" It appears that it will work. I just entered your model number into the Sears Parts website. It identified the 280187 drain pump as being the correct model. This is an easy part to replace and took me about 20 minutes. However, I would have a couple of large towels handy because water will come out of the pump when you pull it. This part on Amazon is about $40 cheaper than ordering from Sears or buying locally. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Whirlpool Duet GHW9100 LW1. I only want the pump motor not the whole assembly. Is this the right whole assmbly? Can I get just the motor?\n Answer:","completion":" This pump fits a broad selection of these washers, check with a technician or technical maintenance website to confirm fit.

{"prompt":"Question: I have a Kenmore Elite HE3T with the part number 461970201671 and 294020-M75 on it. Will this one work and fit?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if it will or not, really. Does your old part look like this one? One large input port and a single smaller output port will probably work with a lot of the modern washing machines, but this one was made to fit the bracket on the Whirlpool. Since Whirlpool makes Kenmore washers, it may well fit. Check your old pump for a part #.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my Wirlpool modle is GHW9150PW0. will this pump is correct part?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes save the old rubber bushings to put on new pump\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will it fit maytag cre9400cce\n Answer:","completion":" This unit extends 16\" out from the back oven wall in the interior of the oven. It is 18 1\/2\" wide at the end by the oven door. The support legs hold it about 3\/4\" off the bottom of the oven. The terminal ends could be flexed to match the holes through the back oven wall probably from 16\" - 19\" apart. Terminals about 3 1\/2\" long with slide on connectors. Measure the old bake element to see if these dimensions would fit in your oven. I did not use the one I got in a Whirlpool oven so if it fits it will work.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions\n Answer:","completion":" From center to center of the two plug in ends, it is 18.5 inches at the mounting tabs. About 18.75 overall width. From the mounting tabs at the back of the oven to the curved areas near the door it is 15.5\" overall. The \"V\" legs that keep it from touching the bottom of the oven extend down 0.75\". Because it has been installed for some time I didn't want to disturb and remove. So I didn't remove to measure how far it protrudes from back of oven into cabinet space. I recall when I installed, it seemed like it went in a long way. But nothing went \"poof\" and it has worked perfectly. The Amazon illustration shows the lower leg spread apart. There is some flex to it, and I gently squeezed into place. Remember to unplug before starting repair. It's 220 volts.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work for a Whirlpool ED5VHEXVB04? I have already purchased a door chute kit but then realized one of the plastic hinges were broken.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It will work. I think every Whirlpool and Kenmore through the door dispenser has had or will have a broken hinge. The flange was inexcusably under designed for the stress that the spring puts on it and the repair is outrageously expensive. The kit should have been supplied free as a recall. Be sure to read the instructions and don't use the adhesive on the top of the bracket. The adhesive is impossible to remove without destroying the bracket. The kit is universal and on that model when you try to install it the top adhesive will instantly grab before the bracket is properly seated against the back and the door will not seal all the way. If the door does not properly sealed the dispenser will frost up.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how do I replace Whirlpool 902894 Door Gasket?\n Answer:","completion":" Pull the old gasket out of the groove. Clean the groove out with soapy water. Insert the new gasket with flared side toward the groove (the flare-out helps the gasket stay in the groove). Start gasket at one end, putting pressure on the gasket with your fingers to seat the gasket around the opening.

{"prompt":"Question: My dishwasher has such a strong suction after running a load that the door is hard to open and then rips the gasket off when you finally open the door\n Answer:","completion":" If it is an old gasket replace the gasket remembering to put the fatter side into the bottom of the channel.then make sure the door has been completely clean where it meets with the gasket, then take this area and put olive oil around the door where it meets the gasket.for a new gasket all you need to do is make sure that the door is really clean and then put the olive oil around the edge.\n"}

While it appears simple enough, there are tricks to installing. IE: You must first heat up the gasket in hot water to increase it's pliability. (Check YouTube) Additionally, at least for my model they have a feature change. After this seal did not work for me I went and bought another from a local Maytag distributor, the seal design is completely different and it comes with a new latch.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this an oem part\n Answer:","completion":" It is a universal part that connects with wire nuts to your existing plug in pigtail.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this only work with the CO2 treated Heineken and Newcastle mini-kegs or can you plug in any Mini-Keg on the market or a homebrew?\n Answer:","completion":" The instructions included with this unit imply that any 5L gravity or pressurized keg will work. The instruction manual states the following : \"This unit will cool and dispense beer using 5L gravity kegs and pressurized kegs.\" The manual then states \" There are two types of 5 litre kegs available which can be used in this cooler. The first type is pressurized and the beer is dispensed through the upper lid mechanism. Only pressurized beer kegs can be dispensed through the top. Install the dispensing tube supplied with the pressurized keg into the center top of the keg. DO NOT install the small plastic paddle that comes with the pressurized keg. Gently lower the keg into the cooler taking care to line up the dispensing tube with the cooler's spout. The SECOND type of 5L keg is NON pressurized (gravity dispense), and utilizes the small clear door on the side of the cooler. Line up the spigot on the side of the can, pull through the small door opening and dispense per the instructions on the keg.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with a co2 system or do you have to use kegs with co2 like Hineken?\n Answer:","completion":" This is simply just a mechanism to keep the beer cold. It does come with supplies to be able to use Heineken mini-kegs, but we have not tried it out yet. We have only used mini-kegs that have the plastic spout (I think those are called gravity fed? not sure on the term). The cooler has a little clear window towards the bottom that the spout sticks out of.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what's the lowest temperature it achieves?\n Answer:","completion":" It'll give you a decent cool temp but if your lookin for that really cold beer it just ain't gonna happen.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of beer can you use?\n Answer:","completion":" I've used Heineken and warsteiner so far, there are a handful more. You can google 5 litter kegs and purchase them online.. May have a larger collection than your liquor store.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is the unit made?\n Answer:","completion":" It is made in China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many glasses of beer is in mini keg\n Answer:","completion":" How big is your glass? :-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does CO2 work? Or does this mini-keg system only work with pre-conditioned CO2 mini-kegs like Heineken and Newcastle?\n Answer:","completion":" The cooler is a chilling vessel which a pre-pressurized 5L keg is inserted. Additionally, the clear window on the front allows for a gravity fed keg to be utilized - it appears a wine cooler with a similar dispensing mechanism would also work - if that's your thing\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: looking for ice maker for amana model # ARSE66ZBS does this product work with chill zone\n Answer:","completion":" This ice maker is standard for most Amana models. All the ice maker logic is built-in to the ice maker. The connector brings power of the motor and heater and sends the command to the water valve to fill the tray. If your refrigerator is a side by side type, the ice maker mounts all the way in the top back of the freezer. Since the freezer is narrow, removing the old ice maker is not easy. There is a latching type molex connector all the way in the back corner and there is very little room for your fingers to press the tab and pull at the same time. Once the old one is out the rest is pretty easy. You will need to transfer a few parts from your old unit to this one, set them side by side and move the parts over.\n"}

The container does not include that number as one that it replaces. The supplier has several filters as it appears it is a filter store. EcoAqua.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there any accreditation on this?\n Answer:","completion":" That is a good question. I don't see any mention of it, where you think there would be if it had it. Interestingly, the Clear Sip brand mentions ANSF\/ANSI certified.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What exactly does the 'Hydro Cell\" do? --with reference to it being an advanced water maintenance system with 'activated carbon technology'?\n Answer:","completion":" It does nothing....carbon will remove impurities if water or air are FORCED through it....this simply floats around & does nothing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where does the Hydro-Cell go?\n Answer:","completion":" It should go into the trashcan. This is a plastic disk with carbon in it. Carbon will filter impurities from the air or water if air or water is forced through it. This thing just floats around doing nothing. It has no microbiological properties like the original silver stick or the silver cube do. This thing is worthless. That's why even the company won't tell you what it does.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this product compatible with the AOS 7144 which normally takes a Hydrostick?\n Answer:","completion":" The Hydrostick was made with silver that actually kills bacteria. It worked well and I'm really mad they stopped making it. These disks MAY help with odor or chlorine idk, but they won't protect the base of your humidifier from mold etc... You could get the same or possibly even better effect by just running your water through an inexpensive water filtering pitcher before filling your tank.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it OK to use Air-O-Swiss Hydro Cell with Vicks Ultrasonic Humidifier Model V5100?\n Answer:","completion":" The hydrocell just sits in the water reservoir of my Air-o-swiss humidifier. If your Vicks humidifier has the same set up with a wide enough opening to get the cell in (which is most likely), I don't see why it shouldn't treat the water. The cell is 2.5\" in diameter.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: My hydro cell does not float in the water -- it sinks to the bottom. Is that okay?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, Well mine sinks to the bottom too! I really do not know if that is ok... :)\n"}

My ceiling is 10 ft. 3 in.\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, if you have a 10' 3in celing, you will need to order the extension. I just went through the same thing and my celing is 10' and had to order.

I purchased the unit for wall-mount and use a charcoal filter, but you can get the ducting kit as well to vent through a wall or ceiling\/roof\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the hood come with the stainless steel chimney or is that separate?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine came with the chimney - two parts, one sleeves over the other so you can slide it to ceiling height. They aren't full-square \"boxes\", the backs are open (where they go against the wall). Pretty quick install if you're replacing an old one and the exhaust ducting is in place in your ceiling. It comes with drywall anchors - I'd really advise you mount it to wood or framing though!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the loops hanging down?\n Answer:","completion":" The loops are handles to remove the baffles. There are three removable baffles. Each baffle has a small button in the front and a handle in the back. To remove the dishwasher safe baffle, push the button then grab the handle.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My contractor asked if this hood is \"self-ventilating\"?,he says my old hood was self ventilating, so there is no venting to outside of house.\n Answer:","completion":" It can go either way vented out or charcoal filter, I vent mine out so not sure how well filter works.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you have installed manual ? I need to replace my wall mounted hood. The height of the hole at the wall is only 41 inches from the top of stove.

{"prompt":"Question: How many decibels does this emit when the vent is on the highest setting?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't tell you how many decibels, but is no louder than water boiling on the stove. I am very pleased with mine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We do a lot of saute and searing cooking + some wok cooking every so often (Asian cooking!). Can the high setting handle this type of cooking?\n Answer:","completion":" We're the same - and we rarely go to high, even searing a steak in a cast iron skillet, it does a good job. I may have posted this before, but the only issue with this thing is when a bulb burns out, you have to buy an entire lamp housing kit. The bulbs they use have tiny pins compared to standard bulbs. I drilled out the pin holes enough to take the regular bulbs which you can buy by the case.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone tell me the height of hood without counting the chimney ? I need to know it fit the pre-opening on the wall from my old hood.\n Answer:","completion":" you should allow about 12 inches clearance for unit itself...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where can I get an extension for 11' ceiling\n Answer:","completion":" The extra extension piece for a 10' foot ceiling will work. There is at least 15\" extra inside of the joint.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I purchased the Z-line ZLKB30 about a year ago and love it. I recently noticed one of the lights go out which I didn't expect this soon. Doesn't look like the bulb can be changed but the whole assembly. How do i go about ordering this part? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" If you remove the filters and look inside, you can push those lights out; they're a standard size reflector bulb. I replaced mine with an LED equivalent. If you take the bulb to Home Depot, they can probably replace it; it's a 12v reflector unit. Get out a magnifying glass and you can read the type on it, and order them online. I don't have one handy or I'd look it up for you, sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the width and depth dimensions of the chimney?\n Answer:","completion":" Depth 8\" Width 9 1\/4\" We are very happy w the product and price.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you get a remote control with this hood? And will it accommodate 9' ceilings?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure about the remote control. Accommodating a nine-foot ceiling depends upon how high you mount it. The chimney does have some adjustment capability. Take a look at the maximum \/ minimum height in the specs (fully expanded length, then consider the height you are going to mount it (the difference between the two is the adjustment zone). Measure from the anticipated height of the base and work upwards. I have really tall ceilings in my kitchen and I setup the vent to exit to an outside wall and the chimney stops short of the ceiling - worked for us. Best I can offer on this.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the shortest height of the hood and chimney part...only have 10\"-12\" available due to cabinet.\n Answer:","completion":" The measurement is 16 inches for the flew (chimney part) from the start of the range hood there is 10 inches. We had this issue but wanted a polished look to our kitchen so we removed the above cabinets and put tile right to the celing in behind. Good luck with your project\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is this to install under a cabinet. The electrical box is in the cabinet above it. I do not want to install as an exhaust model.\n Answer:","completion":" I did not install it this way. However, there is a bracket spot welded on the hood portion itself. This will make it difficult to mount the hood flush to the under surface of the cabinet. You would probably have to mount the hood with the bracket flush to the cabinet bottom and get I think a one inch filler piece.....\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is the chimney, I have 9 foot ceilings. Is the exhaust tubing plastic?\n Answer:","completion":" The hood comes in two pieces the first main one is 16 inches the second on that fits inside and slides up to make up the second stage is also 16 inches but figure you lose up to an inch since you should keep that much at the point that the two are joined together. Yes the exhaust tubing is plastic but I used it since I was dumping the exhaust right from the until to the ouside and a metal smoke elbow would not be enough to make it through the wall and to try to make up the difference with metal would have been more work then needed. If your going to discharge the exhaust higher up (more then a foot) then use the metal smoke pipe it cuts down on the loss of CFM since it us smooth inside where as the plastic is ribbed for flexing. By the way I also used a Broan 641 wall cap it works real good with this installation and has not only a backdraft damper but a bird and bug screen.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are those loops for hanging things? What is the noise rating?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you can safely hang items in the loops. I'm not familiar with the US standard, but I can't complain. I would say medium-low noise.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this unit work with 10' ceilings? If so, what would I need? Thank you!!\n Answer:","completion":" My installation was for a 14 foot ceiling. The chimney extends upward. I vented to an outside wall so it worked fine for that application. It depends on whether you intend to vent upward through the ceiling - mounting height is a factor. I believe the chimney extends to a grand total of three feet. If you plan to go upward through the ceiling, Amazon does sell a chimney extension kit: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ZLKBWEXT-1-Piece-Extension-Model-Range\/dp\/B00E4Q0FF6\/ref=pd_sim_la_2\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the width exactly 30\"? I'm installing wall cabinets now while waiting for shipment. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Runs at 29 3\/4. 30 on the cabinets gives you just enough room to slide it in place.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the warranty on this hood fan?\n Answer:","completion":" One year parts warranty with limits.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the appropriate item to order if I have the Z-Line KB 30\" (ZLKB30)?

I purchased these three years ago and have been very happy with both products.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My range hood is model #AKDY AZ H601C 90. Will these filters fit? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they do they take a little bit of elbow grease but they do fit\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: if i have a vent that i am using, and i put this thing too. is this will give me any benefit ?\n Answer:","completion":" The charcoal filters are meant to be used when you don't have the access to vent the fan outside. If you already have it vented, there is no point in using them as I don't believe there would be any additional value. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How often do you replace filters?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it indicates somewhere in the packaging how long they last. We ended up venting ours before they needed replacing. The lights on my z line are another story, they burned out after a few months.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit over the top of a 7 inch wide vent pipe?\n Answer:","completion":" Not really the back has a bracket that fits into the vent it's designed for. I would try something else\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work on a Firebird 30\" wall mount range hood w\/ gas sensor FBGV-10Z-30? Need to know so I can purchase both.\n Answer:","completion":" I do not know. You should contact manufacturer or try and send back if doesn't work? I do know it does an excellent job as we could not vent our hood and took a chance. I love the ZLine hood! So many compliments it works well for venting out of your face!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i have a 10 1\/2 foot ceiling... will this attach to the pieces that came with the hood so that I can get the maximum height?\n Answer:","completion":" That totally depends on the vent hood exhaust length and how far down from your ceiling you feel comfortable with the hood above the grill.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this extension work with Z Line ZL36ar697? If not, can you give me the model number of the extension that fits?\n Answer:","completion":" Do not know. Try mfg's site\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Have 12 foot ceiling. What can I do? Would two extensions fit together?\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't even need the extension for my 10 ft, so maybe the 10 ft. Would cover you. Not sure as I didn't do the install.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I ordered the extension and it does not slides into the piece that comes with the hood?\n Answer:","completion":" who are you and what do you mean? what doesn't \"SLIDES\" into what hood?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am planning to purchase Z Line ZLKB36 and the ZLine ZLEXTKF11 extension. Please advise if this is the correct extension. Whats correct roof cap sz\n Answer:","completion":" Hi jimmy Yes this is the correct piece. I purchased the extension because we didn't know how high we were going to mount the hood, but didn't end ended up using it. When you buy the extension they automatically swap out the standard chimney. I had to get them to the standard chimney piece later.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is it plug in or does it need to be wired?\n Answer:","completion":" It is plug in, but it was easy enough to by pass and hard wire - which is what I did\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it plug in or does it need to be wired?\n Answer:","completion":" It is a plug in. Fyi: it only shows military time and there's no way to change it. It's also very noisy!.\n"}

I ignored it and mounted mine at 27\" above cooktop so my wife and I wouldn't bang our heads on it like we did with the old one.

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be mounted on a sloped ceiling?\n Answer:","completion":" Easy answer, no.

You will pay for shipping to return it but to me it was worth it. Good Luck!\n"}

My point is for the size and it's ability to dissipate steam and cooking smoke and smell is phenomenal! Also a fantastic value. Any other brand name hoods I looked at that were literally three times the price had nearly half the ability of this one. Form and function at a great price. Looks awesome too.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How hot does this dryer get? I have seen people complain that it only gets warm, which makes no sense when drying jeans.\n Answer:","completion":" This dryer has a hot setting. Drying men's jeans takes two runs - the jeans tend to stay moist in one (folded) spot, so you need to unfold them after they have been run through once. I find that my men's jeans are almost completely dry in 80 minutes. That's good for most clothes. Then I unwrap\/untangle\/unfold the jeans and run them a little longer. I only run one pair of jeans at a time, and I control the humidity in the room.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I read i dont need to vent this? is that correct? or do i need to get some sort of indoor vent? sorry just confused a wee bit.. thanks\n Answer:","completion":" This dryer doesn't need to be vented.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this fit all washers, or only the Whirlpool ones? I have a Frigidaire...\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know about the Frigidaire washers; I have a Kenmore, 80 series I believe, and it fit and works like a charm.

{"prompt":"Question: Could the seller please confirm the length of this hose. Why isn't the length in the desciption? It would be stupid to assume it is the length I need.\n Answer:","completion":" 12feet 4inches not adjustable length\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this 12 foot hose be cut to 10 foot\n Answer:","completion":" Unfortunately, if you cut it, you lose one of the ends to connect (male\/female) to a terminal point.

Th\n Answer:","completion":" Normally, when you buy a keg from a liquor store, you pay a deposit fee of like $25-50 to make sure you bring it back. That would be like \"renting\" a keg. You can also buy empty ones on Amazon, but that is more for home brewing. This machine is nice because if you own a keg, you can brew beer, transfer it directly from the glass carboy into your empty keg (once it is fermented of course), and you don't have carbonate it because the CO2 in the kegerator does that for you or worry about bottling it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How does the door attach to the main unit?\n Answer:","completion":" The door does not actually attach to the unit. The door is attached to the filter screen which fits inside the unit and so the door actually sets on the unit like a box top on a box. When you grab the handle you see in the picture the door will come off the top with the screen filter attached to it. I hope that makes sense .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How often should it be cleaned?\n Answer:","completion":" The instructions say to clean out same as your dryer lent screen, which is before\/after every load. There is a window, so that you can seen the lint build-up on the screen. Amazingly, there is lint that gets through the dryer vent. I usually, clean mine every other load. I initially installed this to make it easier to clean out the ducts yearly, but the screen captures a significant amount to be cleaned every other load. I'm hoping I won't have to clean the ducts yearly, by cleaning the screen every other load instead. Maybe I can get away with cleaning the ducts every two to three years.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be installed flush inside a wall or does the whole thing- duct and filter- have to be exposed? I would like a finished look.\n Answer:","completion":" My ductwork is inside the wall with the only thing visible the cover to remove and clean the filter. It is a neat application.

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be mounted sideways? I don't have space to mount it vertically.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see why you couldn't as long as you have sufficient airflow you will still trap the excess lint.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this lint trap be used without a dryer booster? The dryer is 6 feet from the outside vent.\n Answer:","completion":" Certainly. I got it because dryer vent exited into the garage and over the years I had accumulated about 1\/4 inch of lent near the exit. This lint trap from Fantech has successfully captured most of the lint which escaped from my dryer. There still very fine lint which is not trapped. I know because I attached an old nylon hose from my wife to the vent exit. It was very minor. You will also need to use some foam backed strips to seal around the door flange.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have had one of these for years but the filter part itself wore out and I can't find anything to replace it. Any suggestions?\n Answer:","completion":" Before I found this filter I fabricated a home made one using the type of plastic screen wire used for window screens.

{"prompt":"Question: do you have to have a dryer booster fan to use this secondary filter? Or can you just use it in addition to the one in the dryer?\n Answer:","completion":" No booster is needed. We had to pipe the dryer exhaust up the wall and through a bulkhead to reach outside. The Lint Trap was mounted in the wall just above the control panel of the dryer for accessing easily. It is a great addition.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have this lint trap, but it doesn't seal tightly, so the damp air and lint blow back inside my laundry room (albeit microscopic bits). Ideas?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello. Try using either foil tape or, if you want to be able to take it down and reinstall on a regular basis, use wide rubberized clamps which seal the openings between the lint trap and duct. Try searching for FC4 mounting clamp for round 4\" Duct (Pair). Good luck.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Why is this stove $1795 w\/ free shipping on Amazon, but $1696 w\/ free shipping on the Goedeckers site?\n Answer:","completion":" if you notice most dealers are within $40 of each other. these dealers all have a 90% or better approval rating. goedekers is the lowest prices and has a 69% approval rating that tells you something. a few reviews even state wasn't worth the savings. read them all then make an educated decision.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit frigidaire freezer model fffh17fqt?\n Answer:","completion":" No they won't. The ones on the bottom on my side by side are similar to the freezer but the ones in the freezer are shorter and don't have a back or are not enclosed as these are. Double check your model and take a good look at the picture then compare with what you have. Figure you already know this but it doesn't hurt to say it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: can you use the top oven for toast? Want to get rid of 4 toaster if i can\n Answer:","completion":" It is a smaller oven and heats rapidly. We have not used it to make toast (I don't doubt you could) but find it useful for more things than the usual larger ovens found on other stoves. As a bonus you have the larger oven for the holiday 24 pound turkey and the seven rib prime roast. You will not be disappointed with this unit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Found the slider lower rack to be very difficult to install. It appears too wide and will scratch surface if forced. Any suggestions?\n Answer:","completion":" Please refer to page 32 of your manual- it sounds like you are attempting to use the wrong rack in the oven- this model has specific racks designed for the top and the bottom and they are NOT interchangeable. Melanie with Goedekers\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the oven racks porcelain?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they are.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need to buy any extra cords or parts for installation?\n Answer:","completion":" It requires a \"pigtail.\" It is not included because different cities\/counties\/states have different requirements. You can find one at your local hardware or appliance store.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a recommended Griddle pan accessory that works best with this model?\n Answer:","completion":" I did not see one. I did check consumer reports and they did not have a recommendation either. I just purchased a T-Fal griddle pan to try. Hoping it works well. It states it is ok on glass tops and makes contact across the two burners.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the delivery company perform the installation, or do I need to contract an installer?\n Answer:","completion":" If you are not replacing an existing range, you'll need to have an installer.

{"prompt":"Question: We are replacing a range and the space has a 30.25 inch opening, will this fit? It says it's 31.5, but is that with the overhanging range top?\n Answer:","completion":" The stove is 29.5 wide. The glass top overhangs the balance. Should fit mine did. Had no problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with what is needed to have the dishwasher drain run into it and a power cord? We are installing this new and need to make sure that our dishwasher can still drain through the sink drain.\n Answer:","completion":" Your dishwasher has an outflow hose that will connect to a plastic tube protruding near the top of this InSinkerator. You have to use a screwdriver to break out a little plastic partition to let water flow into the grinder compartment before you connect the hose. I don't think mine had a power cord. I was replacing an older unit so I just connected it to the old wires. You will probably want to wire this directly into a house circuit, but could buy a plug and some wire from a hardware store if your unit will be within reach of an outlet under your sink. With \"Cover Control\" you don't need to wire in a switch. You connect the tailpiece of the InSinkErator to your drain through a U-shaped trap. If you didn't have a similar unit before, but just a sink drain, you may have to rebuild the drain pipes a little to put the trap in line with the InSinkErator output tailpiece. That isn't difficult to do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a wall switch. My current insinkerator has a cover that will activate the unit.Will the cover control plus unit operate the same way ?\n Answer:","completion":" Being the unit is internally wired and activated through the cover control I doubt whether the wall switch would be needed.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can someone tell me if I can use a third party (Kohler) flange with this disposal - i.e, will the motor still activate using the Inkinkerator stopper?\n Answer:","completion":" I would think not. The factory flange goes all the way into the mouth of the unit. It has a retaining ring that is used to hold the triangular shape mounting flange that goes under the sink. The diposal then hangs from the triangular bracket. Thats my thoughts. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am replacing a 1HP Kitchenaid that is 14 years old. Should I be concerned about downgrading the HP?\n Answer:","completion":" From what I've been told this is the mother of disposals. It's very quiet. Our plumber asked why we chose such a big one, we didn't need the HP but wanted the safety switch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the water capacity in this unit?\n Answer:","completion":" I guess I don't understand what you mean. The water is draining out as it is grinding.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it work with the InSinkErator STS-00 Dual Outlet SinkTop Switch?\n Answer:","completion":" Why? The stopper\/top is the switch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it come with a power cord attached ?\n Answer:","completion":" The cord does not come connected. I remember having ordered a cord for it. The reason they don't include it is because some people hard wire it. It's inexpensive and really simple to attach. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to connect. The only thing that could slow you down is if you are color blind. Additionally, if you are replacing a current insinkerator product it takes about 1\/2 hr to install. I replaced mine from 15 years ago and it attached right to the old sink flange.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the dimensions from the bottom of the sink to the bottom of this disposal once installed?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't really answer, as that unit is at my mom's and not available for me to measure. I have a batch feed unit, model \"Cover Control\" and it is about 15 inches below the sink. Mine is about 5 years old, and not the 'plus' model. The factory sheet (www.insinkerator.com) says 16.25 inches, and I'd want at least 2 inches below it, which you might need to maneuver it into position.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does the cover control work? If you have to keep water running AND put the cover on how does the water get into the disposal while its running?\n Answer:","completion":" The cover water from the faucet to flow through at full speed, but there is no splattering. We have had this disposal for about a year and really like it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the capacity and can you use tap water or does it need to be purified\n Answer:","completion":" I forget the exact capacity but it is large and I believe it was listed either in the description or in the questions on Amazon. It's a large capacity though. I just use tap water, nothing said \"purified only\" or anything the way some others do. Seems to work fine though I haven't had it all that long. Also I haven't used it as much as I might because I need to find a new spot for it. For some reason it interfere's with the TV signal when it's running from where it is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you turn the lights off?\n Answer:","completion":" Not the power light but that isn't overly strong the way it is on others and this doesn't give off diffrent \"mood\" type lights the way others do either. Also if the power lights (two small dots) do bother you for any reason you could just turn the unit around and spin the top half way so the spout is still pointing out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: any thought s on if this would be too big for a baby's room?\n Answer:","completion":" i think it would fit in really well. it is really no bigger then if you bought a humidifer from your local store. the Daditong does the work of two items in one. it sends a calming aroma as well as puts moisture back into the air. of course you would want to set it where little ones couldn't reach it. if i still had small children \/ babies i know i would not hesitate to put one in their room. i have used a humidifier and i had to keep an eye on it as it would run out of water. where as you can set the Daditong up and it will run all nite without running out of water. i don't think you could use anything better than the Daditong it fits in any decor.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the outer material of this machine real wood, or plastic?\n Answer:","completion":" Faux Wood\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The product description says \"reuse for two years\". What does that mean? How long does the product work to effectively absorb odors?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm only a customer and what follows is what i know of their 'rap' on the product: The bags are filled with volcanic ash that absorbs odors. After some period of absorbing stink, the product can be placed outdoors in the bright sunshine for a day or so and it gets renewed and can be reused 'for two years' I guess you'll have to decide when it merits refreshing\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Mine will not stick to the refrigerator. How do you make this happen?\n Answer:","completion":" Attach a small Command hook to the inside of the fridge, remove the suction cup from the Moso bag, and hook the bag over the Command hook.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you have to soak these bags in water first? I had some prevously that you had to soak and it was sort of a pain...Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I did not see that on the instructions so I do not think so.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: For how long do I have to put the bag in the sun to refresh ?\n Answer:","completion":" I leave mine out for a few hours (2-3). Not sure if that is the recommended but it works for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the 75g size?\n Answer:","completion":" I would guess that it would be, based on the 200g bags I have which are roughly twice the size. The dimensions they give in description are wrong, the bag is smaller than the size they quote (see the photo up of the product in the fridge to see size comparison next to food items.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between this unit and the O3 Pure Eco Laundry Ozone Washer System? How would you choose between the two?\n Answer:","completion":" The difference between the 2 is that Pure Ecco requires you to choose between a high flow or low flow model. Which means pick based on how much water your machine uses. So 2 models with pre defined settings for low water wash or more traditional deep models. Wash-it has 1 model for low water wash ans deep fill models. The washers wash system determines water usage not the 03 machine. They both use the same science and apply the same 03 methodology. Also, with wash it, there is a knob that you \"tune\" to ionize the water which is a great application in that based on water conditions the ability to tune the machine to the proper ionization level will ensure your machine properly ionizes the water to get your clothes clean. When the Wash-it logo lights up, your water is at the correct ionization level and you are ready to use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it safe for septic tanks?\n Answer:","completion":" Call the manufacturer at 1-855-392-7448. The gentleman there was very helpful at responding to questions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This sounds too good to be true. Is it? Without being too scientific, how dooes it work?\n Answer:","completion":" Using cold water ionized by the Wash-it unit clothes have odors and dirt removed. The ionized water lifts the dirt off of clothes and removes odor.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it really get whites clean?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I have received feedback from family that is using this unit that it does work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this unit have to be serviced? Does the unit require replacement filters - etc. after a period of time?\n Answer:","completion":" No filters or replacement parts. It is warrantied against faliure or in the event it might need actual service. Again, no filter replacements or parts to change out to keep it working like it should.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What voltage does the wash it have? Is it available in 220 V?\n Answer:","completion":" The voltage of this product is Input 100-240V \/ Output 12V\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What voltage does the wash it have? Is it available in 220 V?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know, but it would just be a matter of getting the right adapter. The current one that is included is for 110-120volts AC to 12volts DC. So you would need one to go from 220volts to 12volts DC. You may want to try to call the manufacturer or you could just buy it and find your own adapter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have an older style washer does this system work for all types of washers?\n Answer:","completion":" you should be fine... the system has nothing to do with the age of your washer. You just screw your water hoses from your washer onto the Washit. the Washit hose gets screwed onto the water spigot itself. It provides the water into the washer instead of being hooked directly to the water line. What I do notice is for me anyway... the washer takes longer to complete a load. I believe this is due to the amount of water being feed through the Washit system itself. If you call the company, they can tell you how to adjust some of this pressure! Best wishes!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My wash-it light isn't working. We washed 3 loads and now the light will not come on. We have slowly moved the lever from standard to HE and back.\n Answer:","completion":" Make sure that the hot water supply to the washer is turned off, or connect your hot water supply from the washer to the second port on the \"wash it\" to fool your washer's temperature sensor, or try setting your wash load to cold water only, sometimes that will work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with good directions?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.very simple setup.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the griddle come with the stove or is this an extra purchase\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how hard is it to keep the stainless under the grates on the top clean - can you use scouring pads?\n Answer:","completion":" Grease and is really visual.

{"prompt":"Question: how does it vent\n Answer:","completion":" It would need a hood or microwave with a hood. It has a vent on the back, but that is for the convection air movement.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with the full manufacturers warranty? Do you deal with GE directly if there is a problem?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it does come with the full warranty.

It's really nice looking and looks commercial without the $7,000 to $10,000 price tag!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it has a lock option? I was wondering if this product has a lock option in order to prevent a kid that could open the valve.\n Answer:","completion":" The lock option locks the key pad to prevent any child from turning it on accidentally.

{"prompt":"Question: What is meant by a slide in sealed burner\n Answer:","completion":" Slide in means that it is not finished on the sides of the range and that it slides into the open area so you don't see the sides. Where as a drop in means that it is finished on the sides so it can go between two cabinets or stand alone in the kitchen. Slide ins also does not have the back splash operation buttons.

The first use, the food stuck to it!\n Answer:","completion":" Yes I just oiled it and heat it on high for at least 5 minutes before putting it to the temp I want.

{"prompt":"Question: are they stackable\n Answer:","completion":" Randy G. asks if this combination washer and dryer are \"stackable.\" My sense of this is that they are not. Stackable washers and dryers are built to their own specifications for weight and height. However, you should contact Maytag and ask them directly. They probably have units very much like these products that are. You can also contact Western Appliance here in San Jose, CA and ask them. I didn't purchase these from Amazon, but rather Western Appliance. Western Appliance STANDS by their products and customers. I know because I have returned products before to them and gotten credit for it towards new purchases, etc. If Western Appliance stands by me, I will stand by them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the overall height WITH the pedestals 55\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Actual height with pedestals is 54\". That's with adjustable leveling feet all the way down ( my floor is level). So 55\" of clearance would be needed if you were sliding it under something.\n"}

Did you buy the extended warranty &amp; feel it's worth $\n Answer:","completion":" We did not buy the extended warrenty, We generally do not buy any extended warreny. We believe that if the product is defective most likely will be during to regular warrenty. Also, most repairs have you pay the deductible and ususaul with the deductibale and the price of the warrenty that you paid for, you are most likely paying out what the machine is worth for its age at the time.

{"prompt":"Question: Will R-134 freon technically work in a system that uses R-22? or R-12? The term \"work\" is a scientific term of physics\/Mechanical Engineering\n Answer:","completion":" All AC systems are engineered specifically for only one refridgerant. This is because each refridgerant has it's own requirements and specifications as to how it must be pressurized, what oils must be used, and what ability it has to efficiently cool. A system built for R22 or R12, will be built to accept different pressures and will use different oils than a system built to run R134. This is why for the most part, refrigerants are not interchangeable between various systems. My understadning, is R134 is not as efficient as R22, and will cause an increased load on the compressor, resulting in system failure.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does the oven have a conventional bake mode or only convection?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it has a conventional bake settings. But I prefer the convection setting - especially for baking breads and pastries. Provides even temperatures through out the oven allowing faster cooking times. Care must be used when opening door in convection mode. Keep your body to the side of the door as wall of heat will hit you if your standing in front of it. Wait a couple seconds before reaching in as this could be quite painful from experience. I'm quite pleased with this unit and love the induction top. I find it better than cooking with gas. You will need induction cookware for it to work. Train family members to use care as the glass surface is susceptible to scratches. I use pot felt pads when placing hot stoneware on the range surface. Stoneware has coarse surface that will scratch the glass.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I would like to use the range as a stand alone slide in. Is there a kit required?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sorry but I do not understand your question. \"Slide ins\" are by nature \"stand alone\" The primary difference from traditional ranges is that they are designed to be placed within a cabinet opening designed to present an integrated appearance. Thus the range top has edges that form a 3\/4 inch flange over the counter-top so that cooking spills do not leak down the sides. The counter top opening therefore must conform to the size required by the range (both width and height). Do not confuse \"slide in\" with \"drop in\" Make sure your counter height and width conform to the required spec or that you can alter it to bring it into spec. Ours fit in perfectly and my wife is overjoyed with it. Google \"slide in vs drop in\" in if you are confused over the difference between them. Also make sure that all of your cookware has enough ferrous (iron) material to allow a magnet to stick firmly to the base or the induction range will not work with it. Ours heats a proper saucepan filled with water to a full boil in less then two minutes. Its very responsive. I would not recommend this range to be used without a counter-top at each of its sides. The glass cook-top would have exposed edges that normally lie upon the counter-top and are therefore well protected from possible physical strikes resulting in consequent damage or breakage. Additionally the sides, while painted, are not designed to be exposed to view such as a standard range sitting at the end of a counter with one side exposed to view where a finished surface on the side of the range is desirable.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this range require a countertop along the back?\n Answer:","completion":" No countertop is needed. It pushes directly up to a wall. In fact, the oven vent is raised an inch or so above the back of the cooking surface, so if there were a countertop behind it, the vent would stick up and look a little strange.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you use two burners at once with a cast iron griddle? Is it picky about matching the size of the pot to the burner size?\n Answer:","completion":" The Owner's Manual states: \"NEVER place or straddle a cooking pot or utensil over 2 different surface cooking zones heating at the same time. This will cause uneven heating results and could cause the ceramic cooktop to fracture.\" I've found that the burners aren't very picky about pot sizes; best practices would be to use a pan\/pot with a bottom not more than 1\/2 inch larger than the max size markings, or less than 1\/2 inch smaller than the min size markings.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can it wash 1 or 2 towels at a time?\n Answer:","completion":" I have owned this machine for a few months now, and consider it a great purchase. I will answer your question, though ... by explaining how I use it because I have gone through quite a bit of trial and error, and now set it up in the best way that works for me. First I get the lid to a large plastic tote bins that I have. ( Something you can find at probably every dollar store, Walmart etc ) and lay it TOP DOWN in my bathtub. This prevents the water from submerging the bottom of the machine in any way. Then, I fill the washer side ( making sure the dial is set on WASH first ) using the hand held shower head I have. It works just fine. I don't need to use any fancy hoses, levers, etc. I know a lot of people out there do that. This works best for me. As for soap, I either dilute a laundry pod ( as I have a bunch of them anyway ) in SIX CUPS of water ( you will have TONS left over ) and use 1 TEASPOON of that, per load .. or one teaspoon of regular liquid laundry soap. I usually turn on the machine about half a second just to see suds in the water.. I don't think it's needed though. Now, this is what I do per clothing item per load: ( for two people living in my home ) - NO MORE then 5-6 tops - NO MORE then 3-4 pants ( depending on their thickness. Jeans, two per load ) - Under clothing items, I always have a lot and I always throw them all in, but be prepared to untangle socks .. so if you do not want to do that,do your socks in small loads orput them into a THICKKKKKKKKKKKK laundry bag. ( I say thick because this machine will tear the regular small ones to absolute shreds ) - Bedding, yep, bedding ... I do the cover sheet AND the top sheet together. If you want, it can handle two pillow cases along with. I don't do that, I wash the pillow cases ( cuz there is four total ) with my tops. Works fine. - Do not, do not, do NOT wash ANY blankets in this machine other then baby blankets. - Towels .. now we have standard, large towels and I will NEVER again put more then two in at a time. As well, I will NEVER put more then 3\/4th a teaspoon of laundry soap in with the towels because they REALLY REALLY suds up the machine. It doesn't matter how may times you rinse, it causes tons of suds. You will be rinsing for hours, or have to take the towels out and rinse by hand. I do all wash clothes, dish towels, hand towels together. ( Usually 7-9 pieces total ) The times I have found that work best per clothing item per load: (Seriously, screw what the numbers say or what the booklet suggests ) Tops - 5-7 minutes if you have heavily soiled tops, I don't see an issue with going as much as 9 minutes. Also, if they are delitcate tops, lace, etc .. 3-4 works fine. Pants - 7-10 minutes. Heavily soiled, 10 might still be enough, but go ahead and add more if they are like muddy, etc. ( In which case, you don't wannal oad the machine up too much with mud etc) Under clothing - I run em the full 15 minutes. Works great. Towels, 13-15. After washing is done, drain. Then refill to rinse. You have to do this or your clothes are gonna be sudsy. Go ahead and leave clothing in machine while your draining and refilling. Then, run the rinse for HALF the amount of time you just washed. Then drain the machine again, take cloths out of the wash and put into the spinner. Now, for every load, you wanna SPLIT it in half to spit. For example, if you just washed four pairs of thin pants, put two in at a time. ( The spin side is smaller anyway ) Five shirts, two first, then three next. Towels ONE AT A TIME. The hand towels and etc, I spin all at once , or split in two loads, it works fine. Then hang up or throw in dryer if you have one. Now it was dead of summer where I live when I got this and its cooled now to 80s ... our clothes take the entire day to dry, unless you got a fan blowing on it. I have hung laundry on hangers for more then ten years, so this does not bother me. I know I have said lots here but I truly love this machine. It has saved money at the laundrymat and saves energy... however, be prepared to be messing with your machine quite awhile on laundry day unless you use it for washing odds and ends. Also, I would STRONGLY advise NOT using any liquid fabric softner. I am very sensitive to the stuff personally, but can tell ya, this machine doesn't really get it out real well. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need to add water for it to rinse?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you add water for the wash, add clothes and soap, run the wash cycle, drain, add water for the rinse, run through the wash cycle again without soap, drain. Take the clothes out of washer, squeeze a bit, put them into the spin section and run. The clothes are very clean and get as dry as they would from a regular washer spin cycle. Much easier for me than washing by hand. Tip: you only need a very small amount of soap, Even a little too much soap and you'll probably have to rinse several times.\n"}

Hope this helps ;-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many pounds can i put in ?\n Answer:","completion":" 7\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to use it without getting caught by the owner water usage i want to buy one\n Answer:","completion":" It's a small enough machine so you can hide it in your closet when not in use. Not too noisy either. Water usage is about 1.5-2 buckets full of water, plus what you use for rinsing. It's less than what you'd use filling up your bathtub for a bath... When I use this, I use the method we used to use when I was a child and haven't had an automated washer. This method will save you water, too. : Fill the washer part with water. Warmer water should be used for whites. Fill up a bucket or a children size tub with colder water for rinsing. Separate your laundry by colours, and start the wash with whites. When the whites are done, twist them over the washer, so the water will stay in the washer, then put the laundry into the bucket filled for rinsing. Then put the next, darker coloured bunch of laundry into the same water in the washer. Wash it, and during that rinse you whites in the bucket, then twist or squeeze them before placing them in the spining part of the machine. Once spinned, shake the items to reduce wrinkles, then hang them on a drying rack or wire or hanger to dry. Same to do with the darker colours. As you get ahead with the process, the water temperature will be reduced as well by time. You'll save water, gas or electricity to heat the water and probably time as well. As said earlier, for one wash for all or most colours you use less water than using by having a bath or a long shower. Obviously if it is more than one person's laundry, you might need a bit more water and time, but the amount of water used will be still less than having a bath each. I hope this helps. And one more thing. Sometimes landlords don't want washers installed in apartments, because of lack of space or because they are afraid of leakage. I can assure you that you can spill more water by handwashing your stuff at home in the bathroom than by using this washer carefully, not to mention that those landlords would not think of such options as this portable washer. I'd might go to my landlord and ask for permission, rather than hiding it and doing laundry secretly. But all circumstances differ as all people are different.\n"}

But knowing once cut apart they could not be rejoined, I placed them in different poistions over the course of a couple days, and quickly realized they looked perfect and did their job great. Just be sure to place the magnetic side against the stove, not the countertop. If they still need a trim, I suggest you use very sharp, and high quality utility scissors to ensure a smooth cut.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will this unit work horizontal vent ( wall vent)\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, this will work with a horizontal vent.

{"prompt":"Question: is it horizontal venting or vertical venting\n Answer:","completion":" Mine is vertical venting. The unit looks beautiful in my kitchen. It's difficult to install; reason is that the lower chimney is attached to the base unit and to mount the 2 screw holes in the back is not easy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have 9' ceilings. How high does the vent go?\n Answer:","completion":" About 24\". The vent has a retractable\/removable extension. For my 8' ceilings I took it off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the vent exit from the top or back of the hood?\n Answer:","completion":" It capable of being ventless with air exchange on the side of the stack or vented through the ceiling at the top of the stack.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I want to vent out the rear wall instead of through the roof. Can the duct bend into a 90 degree turn?\n Answer:","completion":" The back is open all the way up. The metal shaft only has there sides. The top of the metal shafts is also open. It come with a coil tube as well. You would have no problem having it go through a wall vent. However, you would need to mount it high enough that no one looks down the open top or make a cap. We love ours. Very very sharp! Well worth it.\n"}

I can not say that these are the correct ones for your machine or not. I cross checked with different suppliers to make sure they fit my model before I ordered them. You should make sure that the shaft on the spider is not worn before you sink any money into your unit. I didn't and am out the cost of the bearings and seal. To check the condition of the shaft simply move the basket up and down and in and out. There should be no play when you do this. If there is then there is a good chance the shaft is shot. Good luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are the bearings and seal, all OEM?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. No they are not the OEM. The originals were not OEM either. Whirlpool was the manufacturer of your washer but they buy the bearings and seals from other companies. The bearings and seals I get are much better than the rubbish Whirlpool put in them in the first place. Thats why they fail. I have personally done well over 500 of these installs myself. Thats why all my seals are flush so they don't collect water. I hope this helps. Thanks, James.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many lbs. does it wash\n Answer:","completion":" It is designed for small loads; I may say between 4 and 5 lbs. no more. I've washed: Pants (size 31x32), 2 T-shirts (medium), underwear (3 pieces), socks (two pairs) at once. You have to learn to balance the water level (low,medium,high) with the type of clothes (and fabrics) you want to wash.\n"}

The connector that you unplug comes off of the round circular perforated part on the front.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have a grease collection tray or tunnel? if not how does the grease get collected and cleaned?\n Answer:","completion":" No that's the problem. The grease goes up through the grids and appears to collect on them--- ok so far because the grids must be cleaned every time the fan is used. This works well because of the ever time cleaning. IF YOU DON'T CLEAN THEM EVERY TIME THEN THE GREAS WILL BUILD UP PASSING TO THE INSIDE\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with the vent kit to vent outside\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not. You will need the vent\/baffle piece that would mount to your exterior wall - and you need metal ducting. It comes with plastic which even the manual says is not appropriate.\n"}

I have only received 2 stainless pieces measuring 15 3\/4 inches each.\n Answer:","completion":" It doesn't come with 8 feet of chimney. It fits ceiling heights of between 8-8.5 feet. Meaning you use the 2 stainless pieces to make up the distance to the ceiling from the top of the hood.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hello, I left a comment earlier about how mine won't stop beeping and flashing on and off when we try to turn it off, please help\n Answer:","completion":" Hi - we had a similar problem and contacted the company. They were extremly helpful and replaced the unit . A pain shipping it back but the replacement was quick and the second unit works perfectly .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the best method for sealing these mylar bags? How long will they keep staple foods such as beans, rice and lentils fresh?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello, All Mylar bags must be heat-sealed to be effective. There are a few ways of doing this but I think the most common is to simply use a household iron. I have also heard of using a hair iron, which should work as long as it gets hot enough. The recommended sealing temperature is 400 degrees. They sell impulse sealers that work well but are not really worth it unless you plan on sealing a lot of bags. We usually recommend you rotate your food supply every year or two by actually using it. However, when properly sealed, low moisture food like you are storing can stay fresh indefinitely as it is protected from oxidation, bugs, light, mold, and oxygen dependent organisms. If you plan on extended storage, be sure to use quality American Mylar as small holes in the foil layer can let oxygen in whether the bag has been punctured or not, no matter how thick the entire laminate material is. A Long-Term Food Storage Guide is included with PackFresh products and you are always welcome to send us your questions as well. Have a great day!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do all the O2 absorbers have to be used at once or are the individually sealed?\n Answer:","completion":" No you don't use them all at once, just reseal the bag the absorbers come it with a hair iron or regular iron. Just be careful when you cut the package to access the absorbers because you want to leave enough room to reseal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What thickness are these bags? (4.5, 5, 7 mil)?\n Answer:","completion":" THESE BAGS ARE 4.5 .MILLS THICK.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could you be more clear regarding holes in the mylar vs holes in the foil and what makes your product superior?\n Answer:","completion":" Sure, I am happy to. There is a popular misconception that there is one Mylar film and the thicker, the better. Actually, there are many kinds of Mylar films which consist of layers of different materials that serve different purposes. Mylar itself is a transparent member of the polyester family that is remarkably strong. The Mylar in this film has a bursting strength of 69 pounds per square inch so it can withstand a lot of abuse. In order to make the film a protective barrier to oxygen, a foil layer is added. (oxygen cannot go through glass or metal) This foil layer can be disturbed by folding, moving or filling the bag and you can sometimes see a scratch or a separation during regular use but these are not holes in the film and do not significantly effect the performance of the bag. Mylar bags from Pack Fresh are made here in Southern California and have never been shipped until you buy them. That is how we can afford to compete with the other discount \"mylar\" that comes from China. There are some enlightening Washington Post articles that should make it clear why American-made products such as those from Pack Fresh are superior. Have a great day and please let us know if you have further questions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just received these today and the indicators on the O2 absorbers are both pink but sealed are they still usable\n Answer:","completion":" If each O2 absorber is hard it is no good. If each is like sand and pliable it is still good. Although they may be several in a bulk pack, you will have to open the package and check them individually. But keep in mind, if they have hardened, they still are of a small limited use and combined with other absorbers may do an ample job. LDC\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would these bags be suitable for filling with a boiling liquid? Or would that melt them?\n Answer:","completion":" No a boiling liquid would be bad.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will mylar bags protect against EMP for electronics ?\n Answer:","completion":" no, you would need a 'Faraday cage' type of environment, usually made of copper wires that will intercept the current and send it to a ground thus bypassing the electronics\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Using these bags to store dry dog food in a #2 plastic container. Are the bags shipped so that they do not get creased causing leaks?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello, I am glad you asked this here so that others can read this as well because this pops up from time to time. Mylar is one of the toughest flexible materials ever created. The film we use to make these can take the weight of two and a half cinder blocks EVERY square inch... and folding does not hurt it. (Still, we do ship orders of 3 or more in a large box as long as it is not Fulfilled by Amazon) But Mylar film is transparent. It looks metallic because a separate layer of aluminum has been added to the Mylar. Normal use, even filling it or moving it, will cause tiny breaks in the foil layer that you may sometimes see if you hold it to the light - but don't worry, they are not holes. This happens with all Mylarfoil films and their barrier properties are not significantly effected . I'm glad you didn't forget your best friend! We are now including extra absorbers in all our sets, which is better for items like dog food that have a lot of interstitial air. Merry Christmas!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What thickness are these bags? (4.5, 5, 7 mil)?\n Answer:","completion":" There is NO measurements listed for either the 1 or 5 gallon bag. Having used mylar before, I believe these bags to be of the 7 mil thickness. They are heavy stock! Charles\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can a 5 gal Home Depot (Orange bucket) be used with these bags even though they are not \"Food Grade\"? Doesn't the Mylar protect the food anyway?\n Answer:","completion":" From what I understand if you have. 5 ml thick and it is indeed true mylar, I think it won't matter. But to be on safe side go to Lowes they sell white food grade buckets for 2.90 get 5 or more they are even cheaper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the Range dishwasher safe?\n Answer:","completion":" The Range is not dishwasher safe as per FAQ on the their website. I have grilled frequently with it, though it cannot be put into direct contact with flame or temperatures over 450 degrees.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this with two iphones instead of an iphone and an ipad?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! Range works with any combination of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch that is running iOS 5.1 or newer. Connect Range to one device and you'll get alerts on all the rest.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the thermometer only work when plugged into an ios device?\n Answer:","completion":" Range needs to be plugged into an iOS device to work. You can use Range with iPhone, iPad or iPod touch (compatible with iOS 5.1+).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why only ios?\n Answer:","completion":" Supermechanical is a small team -we focused on one platform to be able to maintain our standard of quality.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: When do you expect an ANDROID (85% Worldwide Marketshare) App?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi there! Unfortunately, Android devices from different manufacturers have their headphone jacks wired differently (the microphone pin is flipped with ground, to be technical), so it'd be impossible for us to support them all. Thank you for your interest in Range.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If plugged into an iPad, can it send push notifications to an Android?\n Answer:","completion":" I think remote notifications are all handled within the Apple servers, so I think that only iOS devices would get them. That question may be better answered by the manufacturer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can alerts be sent to android devices? do alerts show real-time readings?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The title says \"round tip\" but in description says \"sharp tip\" which is it?\n Answer:","completion":" The turquoise one (made for candy-making or beer-making) has a round tip; the red one (made for meats) has a sharp tip\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this thermometer be calibrated?\n Answer:","completion":" Every Range thermometer is accurate to 1 at 135F. In the current version of the Range app (1.2.2) user calibration isn't an option, but we'll be adding it in a future update.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is Range a thermistor or thermocouple thermometer?\n Answer:","completion":" Range is made with the best thermistor available, so it can truly pull the double duty of being both an instant read AND leave-in thermometer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much does this freezer hold.\n Answer:","completion":" Very substantial for its small size you could store 3 20 pound turkeys with room to spare\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it just a freezer or a fridge\/with freezer?\n Answer:","completion":" It's just a freezer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it only a freezer or a refridgerater with freezer. Looking for just a freezer.\n Answer:","completion":" Is only a freezer\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know the inside dimensions? Thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" Juliana, I ordered the 2.2 Midea freezer and when it arrived the exterior size was much larger than I had expected. It would not fit in the space I had available. I returned the freezer and no longer have my correspondence on this freezer. Summary, I recall that the interior cubic inches was less than 2.2. More like 2.1. As you can see, the difference was minimal (that is what I remember). I liked the freezer very much and had the exterior dimensions been adequate I would have kept the freezer. Good luck with your decision. PS: Found Amazon return process 'excellent.' I am a hard grader! Using a yard stick I checked the interior and exterior dimensions. As I recall, the inter\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how is defrost handled-what about electric needs\n Answer:","completion":" would like to help. but, I sent mine back. freezer did not meet size expectations (believe Amazon has modified product dimensions and they are now correct)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the ice solid and hard or is it chompable? I would love true nugget ice but only large commercial machines make it.\n Answer:","completion":" The ice is about the size of a playing marble...maybe a little bigger, with a hole through the center. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you leave the ice in the ice maker or does it need to be removed after it is done\n Answer:","completion":" Sure it will melt and recycle it's self. I leave mine on 24\/7 if I don't use the ice in the tray it will melt into water and begin making new ice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the ice come out with an off smell or taste from the inside of machine being all pastic?? I just bought a different brand with this issue??\n Answer:","completion":" No, mine did not have a plastic taste or smell.\n"}

It's a great little unit if a little noisy...Hope this is helpful. Viv\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: when the ice melts does it remake or drain out?\n Answer:","completion":" Remakes. The ice bin is over the water reservoir so it just melts back into there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Mine came without manual, and the ice full led is on. it doesn't start. how can i solve it? in the avalonbay site the manual download link is broken.\n Answer:","completion":" http:\/\/www.air-n-water.com\/product\/ab-ice26s.htm#resp-tabs4 - this site has the manual if you scroll down the page, you'll find a tab with \"resources\" on it.

{"prompt":"Question: does it keep recycling water once ice melts?\n Answer:","completion":" It has a water repository at the front\/bottom and once you use the already made ice, it brings up more water to create additional water. I love this machine, and my kids love it even more. They find it amusing to watch water go up and become ice. Hope this helps. Steve\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it hook up to water\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not. It's a strictly \"pour in\" water tank.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size are the cubes &amp; are they soft or hard?\n Answer:","completion":" The difference between the large and small is simply girth.

{"prompt":"Question: does this make clear ice? are they square or cresent shaped?\n Answer:","completion":" They are round with a hole in them, they are not clear\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I set the size to large will they all be large or will some be small?\n Answer:","completion":" They will all be the large size. But just so you know.. there is not great deal of size difference between the large and small. The way that the maker works it fills an area with water then it lowers 9 rods into the water and it begins freezing in layers, so all of your ice comes out round and is hollow in the center. Once the freezing time elapses the rods go back up and the ice is pushed into the basket for serving. I hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How noisy is this machine\n Answer:","completion":" I would not call it noisy but you can hear it run. The compressor makes a soft noise while running and every 6 minutes you hear the ice dropping in the basket. Nothing about the noise it makes is excessive in my opinion.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How much water does it take to fill it?\n Answer:","completion":" About half a gallon.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it work on 220v or just 110?\n Answer:","completion":" 110 only\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Anyone use this ice maker \"outside\" in the summer heat? How well does it make and keep ice in hot conditions?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought two and gave them as gifts so I can't answer about them specifically. However, another person I know that has an ice maker does keep his outside, more to keep his beer cold than anything else. Yes, it can act as a cooler but like a cooler, the ice will melt quicker. And like a cooler, keep it out of the sun.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long and how many water refills would it take to fill a side-by-side in-door ice bin?\n Answer:","completion":" It makes ice rather quickly, about 10 cubes every 7 minutes or so (that's just a guess). Problem is the bucket the ice goes in is small, and once it's full it stops making ice until you empty it. So, if you stood there and babysat it, emptying the ice into your ice bin every 20 minutes or so, you could fill a large bin in less than 2 hours. The ice that comes out is only 32 degrees (and melting), and the ice bin in your refrigerator is usually around zero degrees so the ice will stick together as it cools down. My guess is one refill of water would be all you need to stock up your refrigerator.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: would you be able to suggest where I can get the cords and venting? thank you, if they are easy to obtain and aren't pricey i'd go with this set :D\n Answer:","completion":" The cords are very easy to obtain at any local appliance store or big box hardware store(Lowe's, Home Depot ect.) You need to figure out if you need a 3 or 4 prong dryer cord. We do sell dryer cords you can contact me if you would like me to add it to your order, although we do not sell the venting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this set come with all the parts I need to hook my washer and dryer up?

Are there any videos of this washer?\n Answer:","completion":" Since I started looking for a portable washer, I decided to weigh some of my clothes. Shortsleeve shirts weigh about .8 lb, long sleeve shirts are about a pound. Blue jeans are about 3 lbs, lighter slacks are about 2 lbs. IIRC, this one accommodates 11 lbs of clothes so do the math. I have not found a video nor any reviews.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do you really need to turn off the water supply to change the filter? Is this just a precaution?\n Answer:","completion":" I did not completely shut off the water main or the line to the fridge when changing the filter out, everything was fine. That said, lines, pressure, backflow and the like can be different from kitchen to kitchen, so what works for one may not work for all.

{"prompt":"Question: I've noticed people have said their water flow has increased with this filter compared to GE. Could this be because it doesn't filter as well the GE?\n Answer:","completion":" The water flow definitely increased but my husband also got in there and cleaned out a bunch of crud - which is what we attributed the increased flow to. I got this fridge with the house 5 years ago, at which point it was already 3 years old! I'm a horrible homeowner so until I married my husband, this didn't get any attention. Sooo....I can't really say because I haven't used a fresh GE one. That being said, the water smelt and tasted great after we installed this. I compared the water I poured through a Brita filter to the water through this filter and the smell and taste was night and day - way better with the WaterFall filter!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I cannot find any official reference to testing these filters nor official website. How can we know they are safe?\n Answer:","completion":" 'Woder' is a Clearbrook LLC \/ Sunrise Solutions LLC's Brand Name. The Woder website address can be found easily on each filter (Woder dot biz). Woder Filters manufactured using NSF listed components and in compliance with NSF standards. The people of Woder believe a costly certification by NSF does not provide the consumer any value, rather it only serves to increase the cost of each unit. In addition, since NSF Certifications are not required (by any Governmental Agency) in order to market water filtration products, Woder chose to keep consumer costs down while maintaining high production & filtration standards. All of Woder filters either meet or exceed NSF filtration standards & protocols for each respective filter. Woder filters are EPA certified.

{"prompt":"Question: Can it be installed inside the refrigerator, along the coiled plastic tubing?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't say for certain but it would require cutting the plastic tubing and inserting the filter between the cut ends so you would need to have space for it.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the actual size of the numbers...mainly the height?\n Answer:","completion":" The numbers are inside the negative space, the area around the number is what gets stamped with unique sized rectangles. They all vary, but roughly 2\" is average height.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How large is the largest number? 3\"?, etc\n Answer:","completion":" Not even 3\", closer to 1.5\". Fits inside a business card with enough room to write above.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have some rocks I've collected from around the world and want them polished. Is this product capable of making my already pretty stones gorgeous?\n Answer:","completion":" Not really, unfortunately :( This is a great kit for kids who are interested in Rock tumbling, but that's about all. My son's got polished and he was happy, but it didn't do the best job and the heavier rocks definitely crumbles the lighter, more fragile rocks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I make sea glass in this tumbler and is it made to hold water?\n Answer:","completion":" The tumbler even with the seal wasn't completely water tight, and there was much leakage with the month long grinding and tumbling. Using the supplied stones and shopped accessory stones packages we got very good results. Some of the stones took on a translucent appearance, while the others smoothed out and had gloss finish when done. As far as sea glass, I don't know.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the red tumbling container supposed to turn all the way round?

I never had any luck with it and returned it since in my opinion it really is not worth the money or the noise for several weeks.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How much grit do you use? I put 1 T coarse grit in my first batch of rocks and it ate through the plastic barrel. Did I use too much??\n Answer:","completion":" I used the 3 bags of 3 different course grit that came with the tumbler. The course compound turned for 5 continuous weeks. Medium grit for 8 days, and polishing grit for 10 days. There is wear in the interior of the plastic drum, but no more then I expected. Next batch, I'll use two extra grades of polish. The rocks came out smooth but not as polished\/shiny as I expected. Purchased for the rocks our granddaughter \"mined\" at a hunted Halloween mine. We made necklaces and key chains for her to give as Xmas presents. For more serious crafting\/jewelry, I'd recommend a more professional tumbler.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the Original Rock Tumbler have a rubber insert to protect the plastic casing?\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not. First time, ran continuous for five weeks. There is wear to the inside of the plastic drum. SUGGESTION: can be noisy, run it in a remote location (garage). Coat the rubber ring\/gasket w\/grease, no leaks.\n"}

I've done 1 shirt so far and after washing it once it was faded and cracked.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these transparancies white or clear?\n Answer:","completion":" They are rather translucent. But really you don't want to iron blank areas onto your fabric. I cut around my image the best as I can to remove any of the \"unused\" transfer, before I begin to iron. If the blank areas are \"within\" your image, or not very large, I would not worry about them and just iron over them. But do remove any blank transfers around the edge of your image. I hope this helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do i need a commercial heat press for printing in a t-shirt? or a domestic iron?\n Answer:","completion":" just a iron will do. I foyu ar printing on dark fabric, make sure you get the transfer for light fabric. Same for dark fabric, make sure it for dark fabric.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How long does it last?\n Answer:","completion":" The paints are not moist and must be mixed with water to paint and blend. I like this for travel. I've taken them on several trips and they have not deteriorated. So I would say they are hardy and durable. Sometimes I prefer them to my tube watercolors as they are quick, convenient and easy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the case air tight , non leaking for travel?\n Answer:","completion":" Not airtight, but the paints are solid cakes. If you let them dry after use, there's nothing that can leak.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are names of the 12 colors in the box?\n Answer:","completion":" Cadmium Red Hue, Cadmium Yellow Hues,Alizarin red, Ultramarine Blue, Cobalt Blue, Sap Green, Burnt Umber, Viridian, Chinese white, Yellow Ochre. Raw Sienna. Basic solid , vibrant pigments.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this easy to hold in one hand, seeing that the lid is attached?\n Answer:","completion":" It is quite light weight, so if your hand is large, I suppose so. It does NOT have an incorporated thumb loop. I instead always find some handy level surface to place it while plein aire painting. I can't imagine waving it about with a runny wash preparing in a mixing well. Oddly, the W&N Traveler's box with bottle, sponge, etc. although having a thumb loop is even more ridiculous when held aloft, with fold-out mixing areas never quite level, etc.! Having said this, I believe the W&N half-pan box questioned is the very best entry-level kit available. You'll need to augment it with something like a Cotman 3\/8\" flat was however, the included minuscule brush is too tiny.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you give me a link to the refill colors for this?\n Answer:","completion":" They sell half pans here on Amazon, just search for Cotman pans for whatever color you want. You can also refill the pans with tube colors which is more economical. I think there is a 12 tube cotman set that probably has the same colors, or you can buy one tube at a time. It is definitely less expensive to buy them in a set though. The Koi\/Sakura 18 tube set is really nice and of similar quality. I recommend it for refilling the pans when they are used up.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the 12 colors in the box?\n Answer:","completion":" Cadmium Yellow Pale Hue, Ultramarine, Yellow Ochre, Cadmium Yellow Hue, Cobalt Blue Hue, Burnt Sienna, Cadmium Red Pale Hue, Sap Green, Burnt Umber, Alizarin Crimson, Viridian Hue, and Chinese White\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should I purchase the set of 12 or the set of 45? For me painting is only a hobby and I paint mostly in my art journals.\n Answer:","completion":" Personally 45 is too many colors for me. I paint as a hobby too and don't even use all the colors here. Although I wish I could pick the 12 I get! You might go for the 24 color Cotman travel pallet and split the difference. This one is hard to use unless you are doing something really small because the mixing area is so very very small. I would actually recommend the Koi 24 color watercolor box. It is really good and has plenty of mixing space. I went through a phase of wanting to try different brands and small palettes and have gone back to the Koi for small projects like my journal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: please fix the price. i shop for art supplies on Amazon frequently - it's ridiculous that you have this listed as a $1970.00 item\n Answer:","completion":" Good afternoon, You are quite right; although I am not certain why this error has come about, we will ask Amazon to correct the price. Sincerely, Tarot Barnes Product Data Controller The Society for All Artists\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this compare in paint quality to sakura koi 12 color pocket set?\n Answer:","completion":" I've never used Sakura Koi water colors...but I am sure it's a good choice.

{"prompt":"Question: It have to be ironed? Can it used on acrylic?\n Answer:","completion":" This is a terrible product. I believe it has to be ironed but doesn't stick worth a darn. I ironed on to prewashed t shirts, and the parts that did stick peeled off as we wore them. I have used similar products hundreds of times with much much better results. I found it to be a complete waste of time and money..cost of the paper, ruined t shirts, and computer ink it became a very very expensive and disappointing project.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is the core\/shaft of the chuck plastic or metal on these?\n Answer:","completion":" Dale, I actually got this set for my grandson for Christmas, but I've been using the same exact set since 1967. Of course, the case is long gone as are the orginal blades, but I'm hoping the knives themselves are the same high quality metal construction all around, chucks included. The only plastic you should see evident would be the red handle on the big knife, which comes in handy when you attach a miter saw blade, not included with this set, but a great accessory to have. Hope this helps. If you decide to get this set, I think you'll be pleased with these knives. Mine have given me almost half a century of use and I could have passed them on to my grandson, but hey, I'm not done with them yet. ;-)\n"}

I would suggest that the user take their time and handle them safely.....\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will this set cut leather.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes this will. I use these to cut leather. Of course you'll have to use shorter strokes to cut through it. And since my pieces that I make are smaller, I mostly use the 2 smaller knives.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: i have a set almost exactly like this and was looking for a small saw blade i could attach to one of these handles and i mean really small\n Answer:","completion":" Not all hobby knife sets have the hole in the chuck of the large hobby knife for the regular razor saws: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Xacto-X75300-Precision-Razor-Saw\/dp\/B00004Z2U4\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398519480&sr=8-1&keywords=razor+saw There's a smaller saw that fits in the slots: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/No-15-Saw-Blade-Carded\/dp\/B000BREQDO\/ref=pd_sim_op_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=1WKRZYSY07BKVQ5MMS4W That's all I know of on Amazon.

{"prompt":"Question: can you wittle with it\n Answer:","completion":" I use the Xacto knife to build model airplanes which are made of balsa wood. Balsa is very soft and requires a very sharp blade. Xacto knife sets are made for light hobby work and are also good for precise cutting of paper and thin plastic sheets. For carving knives, which is another term for \"whittling\" use the Amazon site to find real knives that are suited for this purpose. There are many different blade shapes and qualities available. Cheap blades are just that and won't work well. It will also be necessary to learn how to sharpen these blades with a set of hones made for this purpose as one would with a regular folding pocket knife. I have whittled lots of things with a Buck knife, and Buck is famous for holding an edge, but one must also learn to sharpen... Real whittling is an art form and one must know how to maintain the tools.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this X-Acto or a knock-off? TIA!\n Answer:","completion":" Its a true X-Acto brand set. If you still have any doubts you can go to X-Acto's site and see this kit.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this 51 lb paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is. The double-sided (coated on both sides) Epson Presentation Paper is 48 lbs. I like the double-sided paper better because it's sometimes difficult to tell which side of the Ultra Premium is the \"right\" side for printing. Both give spectacular results. I use this paper in an HP Photosmart D7460.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Canon pixma ip6700d printer has few choices. which is better - matte photo paper or other photo paper? thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Glossy. Glossy paper will always give you better color, better depth, etc.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this Epson paper with an inkjet printer made by HP?\n Answer:","completion":" I use this paper with an HP printer...the old HP Photosmart D7460 that I've had for years. It works beautifully and the colors are outstanding. I hardly use photopaper anymore since I discovered this stuff. However, I prefer the Epson double-sided inkjet paper. I like the Ultra Premium, but it's sometimes difficult to tell which side to print on. With the double-sided paper, it doesn't matter and you can print on both sides. I do that when I'm doing die cutting that requires folding cut pieces of a die...then the \"back\" color contrasts nicely with the front color.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the paper with the \"Improved Black Quality\" sticker on the box?\n Answer:","completion":" I guess the answer is \"yes\". My package of 8.5X11 Epson Ultra Premium Presentation Paper Matte has that sticker on the front cover. My other packages of the same paper (13 X 19 and 17 X 22) do not but may be a little older.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have an Epson Artisan 1430 printer and will be making prints of my paintings. Has anyone used this paper for that purpose and what results?\n Answer:","completion":" I use this paper all the time. I make a calendar each each and use this paper. It isn't thick like card stock, but it thicker than average paper. You would be wise to mount the print before you frame it, the paper can curve due to environmental conditions (humidity etc). But it is nice paper. I also have the same printer, so you are in good shape.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this paper be rolled and placed in a poster tube?\n Answer:","completion":" Probably. But not rolled too tightly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this paper have any printing or watermark on the reverse side? I would like to use it to print some folded cards.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this paper a \"photo paper\"? Epson's site lists it under \"photo paper\", but its name of course says \"presentation\" paper, not \"photo paper\".\n Answer:","completion":" This is a matte finish photo paper which makes very nice photos. I would order again. You have to print on the right side but both sides are very similar.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many inserts are in this item, i'm confused about that.\n Answer:","completion":" It is 5 pages. They are the clear pocket type pages in which there are 5 sheets of white paper in each one. You can take them out as I did and use other colors of paper, use the paper provided or just put stuff inside. I actually decorate and add my photos onto 2 different sheets of decorative paper for scrapbooking then insert them back to back into the pocket or sleeve as I call it. So I get 10 pages. Probably more info than you need but I hope this helped! ;-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the top loading 12X12 pages for 12X12 scrapbook pages or divided for photos?\n Answer:","completion":" They are 12X12 scrapbook pages\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is there a specific paint used with this? Can you use the 1\/4 oz. Testors paint bottles with it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you can transfer the smaller paint holders into the jars that come with the set. Any testors or even other brand acrylics work best. Just be sure to clean the tubes between each use to avoid build up and clogging\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the airbrush compatible with paints other than acrylic? (Fabric paint, body paint, etc)\n Answer:","completion":" According to the instructions provided, the Aztek Airbrush System is compatible with acrylic and enamel paints as well as lacquers. I have used it with water based stains and dyes to touch up damaged areas on wood finished such as gun stocks and guitar bodies.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the kit come with a can of propellant?\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE LETTER?\n Answer:","completion":" I measured the letter 'A' (the actual letter not the surrounding rubber or plastic) and it came in at about 3\/4\" tall and 5\/8\" wide.

I use these with my 4 year old grandson. I would use a different product if I were doing serious art.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this be used in playdough? I was worried the rubber stamp might come off the plastic part. Or that maybe it wouldn't make much of an impression\n Answer:","completion":" I have not tried to use them in playdough.

Does it have 2 prongs that hold the machine in the case or is it all open bottom?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it does not have a pouch for the foot pedal and no prongs to hold the machine in.

As for the \"ingredients\" of the box, it comes as shown: 5 little blocks with imprint patterns, 3 rollers, and one \"cutter\" wheel (really a wheel you can make little impressions with).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it gluten free?\n Answer:","completion":" According to the Melissa & Doug website, the play dough DOES contain wheat, so it is NOT gluten free.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you thread it\n Answer:","completion":" Turn the handwheel until the needle is all the way to the left position and the green dots are lined up vertically. Making sure the thread guide is at its highest position, put the thread through the loop. Bring it down and thread it through the top hole, making sure the thread is ABOVE the stitch length dial. After threading through the top hold, bring the thread around and thread it through the bottom hole, also from back to front. Drape it over the thread tension adjuster, making sure the tension is not too tight. It must go through there easily. In front of the thread tension adjuster is another hole. Thread it through that and into the hold just on the other side of it. When you see the thread coming through into the machine, using tweezers, put it through the hook to hold it in place and then, using a needle threader, pull the thread through the needle from back to front. Thread should come out of needle facing you. I have found that using cone thread is easier than spool thread, although with some playing around with the adjustments, spool thread will do if its your only color match to the fabric. Make sure you double check the threading procedure as sometimes the thread goes under the stitch length dial or its not threaded through the thread tension adjuster properly. It's hard to explain without a drawing, but I'm not sure how to scan and put it on here for you. Also note that a blind hemmer has no bobbin thread. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i have this blind hemmer where can I get needles?\n Answer:","completion":" This blindhemmer uses ordinary sewing machine needles, not curved needles. They will wear out fairly quickly, so it is a good thing to buy a couple of packages if you will be using the machine much. I buy the needles at my sewing center. The documentation specifies HAx1SP, but that is the same thing as a common 80\/12. I find that the Janome needles I buy in this size work well. You can also buy these on Amazon, though they are listed as Serger needles. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Klasse-Serger-Needles-Type-HAx1SP\/dp\/B002EZU2P2 Sewing Machines Plus carries these and other sewing supplies.\n"}

I've never bought photo paper before.\n Answer:","completion":" I use this paper on an Epson 2880 with incredible consistent results. That being said, I'm using high-resolution images that take advantage of Photoshop, the printer and the paper. I greatly prefer this 'luster' paper over 'glossy'. But that's a taste preference. I found the quality of this paper to be worth every penny. Make sure that your printer heads are clean before starting a print. Finding a nozzle is clogged half-way through a print is no fun. Does the media you're printing need a presentation like this? If not, definitely find something cheaper. It will not make a bad image better.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it work on paper?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a transfer for fabrics. The transfer itself is like a sheet of paper. You put it into the printer, then use an iron to put whatever you printed onto fabric. I don't think it would work at all on paper, that's not what this is made for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I know some say dark transfers, but can't find clear ones for use on dark. Will these not work on a darker t-shirt like cinammon red?\n Answer:","completion":" It works. But remember. The white area is 'transparent'. When you print a picture, the white areas are see-through. I printed a picture with lots of darks and transferred it to a dark shirt, and since white doesn't transfer, it didn't work out right. (Printers don't 'print' white)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: so do I have to print directly on to the transfer paper or do I print a picture, put the transfer paper over the picture and then iron it?\n Answer:","completion":" Cut out picture and add picture to the scanner, insert the transfer papers as you you would regular typing paper and press print.......Cut around the picture of the transfer and turn upside down on material and press with iron according to directions of the transfer. Let it cool before lifting off the material .wa la you have a perfect transfer. If you are doing letters, don't forget to click mirror image on the printer. Good luck .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with a silicone sheet? If not is there any you recommend?\n Answer:","completion":" It just came with the transfer paper and instructions. I ironed on a towel placed between the fabric layers of the shirt. I've never heard of or used a kit with a silicone sheet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: In order to transfer a design a little larger than 8.5 x 11, do you think I could transfer the design in two pieces?\n Answer:","completion":" yes of course, each sheet is a standard printer paper size so you could divide the design in 1\/2 and do 2 sep pieces at the same time along the same margins or just remove the borders when printing so ensure that the whole image gets printed on one sheet of paper\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Printing on a couple onesies, is it better to wash them first? Or use a brand new onesie?\n Answer:","completion":" wash them first or you can use brand new onesies don't matter it is what you prefer, but when you was them after transfer is on you have to wash in cold water, make sure the onesies are 100% cotton\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you know if it works on 100% linen?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe it would. It worked very well on everything I did!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would this work for making doll faces to use on muslin cloth dolls?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe so but the surface would need to be smooth and somewhat flat to iron on.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these transfer drawings? I am hoping to use crayons or markers to have my students make their own design for their Special Olympics shirts.\n Answer:","completion":" No they cant, but what you could do is have your kids draw with crayons and then scan those pictures onto the computers then print them onto the paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the design crinkle, crack, or peel off easily?\n Answer:","completion":" The corners can peel but iron it some more right away. White tees are best I notice for little crinkling, I did a gray and it cracked badly .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you unlock the handle? I just received mine in the mail and there doesn't appear to be any lever or pin that unlocks the handle.\n Answer:","completion":" If you hold the device facing you (the opening where you slide papers), on the right side, on the back, is a little silver handle. Press the device slightly closed and you can swivel out away from you. The only catch is it can slide very deep, become invisible, and be difficult to get out, which is probably why you're not seeing it. I promise it's there and squeezing it closed will make it easier to slide out. Kind of a pain, really...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it a large hole or small?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a normal hole, like you find in school notebook paper or spiral tablets, not a little one like from a craft punch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What country is this made in?\n Answer:","completion":" Box says item is made in China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this paper roll work on TSP113U?\n Answer:","completion":" Janet; yes, this paper will fit. It is the upgrade version to the TSP100 which I own. I have used several suppliers for print rolls and these are not only the best but the most economical. I am about to order another pack. The paper itself is bright white, which makes the printing stand out. This is important for me because my cooks need to see the order they are making when it sits on the ticket holder. The thickness of the paper makes it perfect, some paper looks transparent and recycled paper. This is a great product and fast shipping!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the inside diameter of the roll ?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure. It is the same as anywhere else. But will tell you I was not satisfied with this product as it was too thin. I did not like the way the receipts looked. They were hard to read.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this paper fit the star 300i bluetooth printer\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know but I was not satisfied with this product. Way too thin which made it hard to read receipt.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work in the Epson TM-T20II ReadyPrint Thermal Receipt Printer?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know but beware that this paper is really thin and we found it hard to read our receipts. We ended up throwing all of ours away\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this paper fit the Star Micronics TSP100 TSP143LAN Receipt Printer? I'm ordering it on here and it doesn't specify paper type on the product page\n Answer:","completion":" YES.... I own several TSP100 printers and paper is bright, so far, the best quality I can find. Been buying this brand for over 4 yrs\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work for the two color thermal function, meaning red and black? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" This item I have noticed only turns black when you heat it up its not multi color.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this paper work with the Star Micronics TSP143UII? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this paper work on First Data FD200 ,machine?\n Answer:","completion":" If FD200 machine requires \"thermal paper\", then yes. The paper is the whitest roll thermal paper I have found. It also is much thicker than rolls that sell much cheaper. Quality of printing is excellent, whereas cheaper thinner paper the quality of print was poor. Printing is crystal clear, profound black print with white paper makes receipt easy to read.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this paper work on star tsp650\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, this is thermal paper so is will work with the TSP650. Just be aware that thermal printers and paper do not work well in high heat enviroments like kitchens.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this paper work with First Data FD50 machine? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" It should this is thermal paper and as long as the size is correct you should be good to go.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many pages will it handle?\n Answer:","completion":" I never counted the pages I was putting into it, but the slot where the pages go to punch the holes probably won't let you put to many more than about 30 sheets in it as it is narrow. In other words you can't try to punch 100 sheets at a time as they won't fit in the slot.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it work for legal paper?\n Answer:","completion":" It will punch holes in legal size paper, but the spacing for punching holes cannot be adjusted, so the holes are in the same place as they would be on standard size paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size holes?\n Answer:","completion":" Normal notebooks size.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this to punch holes in laminated paper?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't se why not as you can punch a stack of around 20 sheets of regular paper at once. I would suppose it would depend on how heavy and how laminated as I don't know what keeps the dyes for punching the holes sharp. I can say I would have given this machine more stars if I could as it is so easy to use! Punching the holes is just merely pressing an on off button, similar to turning on and off any other appliance.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What's the difference between '3 hole' and '3 holes' ?\n Answer:","completion":" No idea. i know this one punches three holes right where they should go.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this paper white on the other side, or are both sides black?\n Answer:","completion":" One side is white and the other is the color you select\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you write with chalk on this? Want to use it as a chalk table cloth. TIA\n Answer:","completion":" If it's just to look at it maybe ok...it tears fairly easily, so it won't stand much abuse...I use it for shotgun targets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could it be shredded and used as a packing material for gift baskets?\n Answer:","completion":" It is expensive paper and also thick, I wouldn't think it would be a good filler.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you paint on it\n Answer:","completion":" The paper is fairly thin. It might be suitable for making a hand-painted sign with tempera or acrylic paint, but I would not recommend using it for painting any piece of fine art. This is definitely more of an arts and crafts type paper, not intended to be used for fine art.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work to keep out the sunlight for a party? I need the room to be quite dark. Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would, though for total room darkening you'd be better off with something like black felted cloth. This paper would definitely maker it darker, but if the sun light was directly behind it, you'd need two layers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the paper finish glossy or matte?\n Answer:","completion":" Matte. I used it to wrap gifts, and as a table cover to draw on!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this paper suitable for making patterns for clothing?\n Answer:","completion":" Very much so. This is what I use it for. Either I copy existing patterns, either I create from scratch. This paper is nice and sturdy. One thing to note: I do not use pins, only weights when I'm cutting my fabric so it doesn't matter to me if the paper is a little thicker than usual pattern making paper. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this be used as wrapping paper?\n Answer:","completion":" It is substantially thicker than wrapping paper - but if you are willing to crease in the edges it could work. It would be like wrapping something with construction paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this paper work for wrapping gifts\n Answer:","completion":" It's see through, I've doubled in the past or done painting or drawing on the outside to create my own personal wrapping paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this paper work for a \"tracing an outline of a body\" art project?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work for blacking out windows?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, you may need to use 2 layers but it should\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this paper be used to fold paper flowers? Is it thick enough to hold its shape but be easily folded at the same time?\n Answer:","completion":" I've never made paper flowers but I would say this paper is too thick. Often when I tape a package it's so heavy the tape comes undone. I hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you tape things to this paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, tape will stick to it. I use this paper to wrap gifts. I honestly can't tell the difference between the textured sides so I've painted on both sides and taped both sides.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If you want to cover the tables for a party with this, will it show wrinkles?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it's pretty sturdy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have a \"center\" to be put on a roll... how heavy is it??\n Answer:","completion":" It does have a center however it is very long approx 5 ft so it would likely need a custom roll. It is heavy and bulky. I leave mine in the box it came in, in the garage and lay it on a large table or the floor to wrap my items. It is somewhat see-through so I double wrap sometimes. Hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use this for table covers for child birthday party... to use with crayons. Will this definitely work well with crayons?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely!! I let my kids draw on it all the time using crayons..works great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to lay this over my design drawing (black felt on white newsprint) to trace onto this sturdier paper for quilting base. Is it transparent?\n Answer:","completion":" No. It's too thick to be transparent.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be good paper to paint on?\n Answer:","completion":" I would not advise it to be painted on even though I have used for some light watercolor and a few acrylic paintings. Mostly I use it for large pen & ink work. If your carefull and don't scrub your brush on it or don't get it very wet... it works.... Hope this helps. ;-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to make a ton of fold and cut snowflakes for a wedding. Is the paper bright wht? Same color on both sides? Will it fold easily?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would work great for that purpose. It is bright white and same color and texture on both sides. It's thicker than printer paper but easy to fold. I bought to wrap gifts with it folded around them nicely but ended up being able to see through if boxes were colored so that gives you idea of how thick it is. :) hope this helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We want to have a finger paint square on the wall at my son's birthday party, is this paper thick enough for that?\n Answer:","completion":" It will work great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How big is the center hole of the roll? I need it to slide onto backdrop support system.\n Answer:","completion":" About the same size as a paper towel roll hole. Maybe a bit larger.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you draw on the white side using pencil AND markers?\n Answer:","completion":" It rips very easy so I don't think so\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this paper accept crayons? Certain finishes don't work well with crayons.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How well does this paper take glue? I want to glue paper to foam?\n Answer:","completion":" We used regular school glue and it worked just fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this paper work for wrapping gifts? Is it thick enough to prevent seeing writing on boxes, and will it fold neatly?\n Answer:","completion":" It is thick enough to hide writing on boxes. I am not sure about it folding neatly. I have only used it to cover bulletin boards.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be used for pattern making?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think you would want this, because it rips so easily and does not lay flat.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are you getting 100 sheets total of tissue paper, or is there 100 sheets of each color of tissue paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Total\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this considered to be \"bleeding tissue paper\"?\n Answer:","completion":" yes it is. it was used to \"dye\" easter eggs at a science museum\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come flat, folded or rolled?\n Answer:","completion":" It's been a while since I ordered this, but it came flat as I remember.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I would like to use this to cover windows in my classroom, do you know if it can be used for faux stained glass?\n Answer:","completion":" i used it to \"dye\" easter eggs. Its tissue paper that allows the color to run if wettened. I have made stained glass using white glue mixed with food coloring on transparency paper\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this crepe paper, or regular tissue paper?\n Answer:","completion":" tissue paper\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the picture shows a different product, is black included in the assortment?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, only a few slices, there is a huge variety of colors, just don't get wet. Color bleeds easily\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I make kite out of this? Is it strong enough to fly?\n Answer:","completion":" It is the same strength as ordinary tissue paper, but I'm not a kite flyer. HOWEVER, please read the description very closely because I'm pretty sure (since I'm one of the purchasers of this tissue paper) this is the kind that \"bleeds\" colors, and any moisture will cause the color to bleed into other pieces of the project.. If you did not select the Bleeding tissue paper, I'm not sure. The paper will not stand up to glue, isn't strong enough for tape for any length of time, but may be good for kites. I've never made a kite.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How fast does the color fade?\n Answer:","completion":" I ordered this paper because it bleeds on other papers (for crafting and card making). The bleeding color is lighter than the paper, but, so far, hasn't faded at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need shades of blue for an ombre effect, the picture shows 4 possibly 5 shades of blue. Is the picture accurate?\n Answer:","completion":" I am awaiting a knee replacement and can't go look , but there are many shades of each color. You could possibly even layer two colors to get the effect of another shade.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If this tissue paper safe to wrap jewelry in and mail?\n Answer:","completion":" I have wrapped presents in it days before they were to be unwrapped and there seemed to be no color rub off or other problem, so I would think so.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Might be a stupid question... Is this paper primarily used for printing? Would it work good for hand written letters as well? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" We use it for printing certificates. However, I think it would be great for handwritten letters; perfect for calligraphy work also.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this paper letter or legal size?\n Answer:","completion":" It is letter size.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be folded in three to be sent in a regular envelope?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - it is 24lb paper and handles folding well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this paper support duplex printing with colors?\n Answer:","completion":" I've only ever used it for B\/W laser printing, which it does superbly. The weight and texture would lend itself to being physically capable of duplex color printing, but it would most likely require a couple of test runs to adjust coloration to account for the tinge of the paper itself.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this paper be inserted in wedding invitations in place of onion skin paper or is it too thick?\n Answer:","completion":" no, it is too thick. I use it for programs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this paper have a watermark?\n Answer:","completion":" There is no watermark on the parchment paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions of this paper? 8-1\/2 x 11? 6-1\/2 x 8-1\/2?\n Answer:","completion":" the parchment paper is 8-1\/2 x 11\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do I need to purchase special paper to work with these, if so what should I look for?\n Answer:","completion":" Maybe a nice thik construction paper works best. I didn't get special paper or anything just thick construction paper\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these water soluble like Portfolio Oil Pastels?\n Answer:","completion":" They do not dissolve well in water. When blending\/shading I have had much better success using oil or alcohol.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are they washable?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure but if you get them on your hands they are easy to get off I recommend if you are blending colors to use a napkin\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are they ' soft' enough to be used on fabric? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" I think so.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long are the oil pastel sticks?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't have my set here at home (I use them with my students at school) but they are about 3 inches long and quite fat.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do they show up well on dark construction paper?\n Answer:","completion":" They are ok. If you are an artist looking for a specific finish, I would spend the extra for a brand not geared for kids.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you sharpen them ?\n Answer:","completion":" They self sharpen as you use them. Use at about a 45 degree tilt angle; apply color; rotate\/spin a few degrees and color; continue until you have used all 360 degrees of the crayon diameter and you should have a new point. Works for me. I have never tried a regular crayon sharpener, but the primary (for the big crayons) one with the larger insert hole might work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where are these manufactured?\n Answer:","completion":" According to my box, they are made in Korea.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: CAN THE BE USED AS DRY ERASE MARKERS?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not use this for that purpose.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: CAN THE BE USED AS DRY ERASE MARKERS?\n Answer:","completion":" NO - do not use them on a dry erase board - dry erase markers are not oil-based. These or ANY oil product would stain.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The product photo shows \"Finland\" on the blade. Where are they manufactured?\n Answer:","completion":" Package said made in China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: All of the images on this page show RIGHT HAND scissors - is this, indeed, a LEFT HAND product?\n Answer:","completion":" I am left handed and these scissors definitely did not work for me. The blades are wrong and you can not see what you are cutting. Some reviewers on this site say that they are left handed but I even contacted Fiskars, sent them back, because they said they would send me true left handed scissors and instead the customer service guy sent the ones I sent back to me and apologized saying they have continued to get complaints about them. It seems the handles fit your left hand but the blades are wrong, still machined for a right handed person.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these scissors really work well for left-handed people?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought them for my right-handed friend who's right hand was in a cast. She had to use her left hand to cut things and open bags. She said it worked like a charm, when the right-hand scissors would not work in her left hand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I don't know how to use it after receiving the product\n Answer:","completion":" This punch is very easy to use when you know how. ; } Place the punch on a flat table surface. Face the punch with the arm side towards you. Below the arm is a light gray plastic piece with arrows on it. Push down on the arm of the punch and push the light gray piece to the left. This opens the arm for use. To set the punch for using other options than the 3 hole punch: Under the punch are black screws. Loosen these and move them to the proper location for your punching needs. Tighten them back up when in the proper location. Punch away!! If you have any other questions, I would be pleased to answer them. This is a fine product. Patricia\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How to get to UNlocked position? I see the little gray arrows but nothing moves.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I can help! Place the punch on a firm surface. Side facing you should be with the gray arrows. Hold down the punch arm and move the gray piece to the left. It will unlock. You must have the arm held down to lock or unlock. I hope this helps, it's an excellent punch. If you have trouble or have any other questions, ask away. Patricia Robinson.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking for some way to hole punch print outs to go in a mini binder (8 1\/2\" by 5 1\/2\"). I'm ok with extra holes. will this meet my needs?\n Answer:","completion":" yes. on the backside of this hole puncher (I don't think you can see a picture of it) it has adjustment tabs so you can move the hole(s) placement to literally anything that suits your needs as long as its smaller then 11.5\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I get the extra punch heads to do 7 holes, will the pattern adjust to my daytimer folio size planner?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, I don't know.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you adjust the hole positions?\n Answer:","completion":" There are screws on the bottom and additional holes. Unscrew the punch and move it to the place you want it to be, then screw it back together.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a FC Classic Binder (7holes) page size 5.5\" and 8.5\" and a FC Compact Binder (6 holes) page size 4.25\" x 6.75\" Will the puncher fit my needs\n Answer:","completion":" No, it only has the capability of punching 3 holes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this line up to punch a5 pages for a Filofax?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure-\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where can you get extra punches to make the 7 holes claimed that you can punch?\n Answer:","completion":" http:\/\/www.swingline.com\/swingline\/us\/us\/s\/2298\/punch-heads.aspx#.UtIyBtJdV94 I found this website by searching for swingline parts. You have to know the model number of the punch since there are many punch parts available.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought this new. It is already in the unlocked position but will not open for paper insertion.\n Answer:","completion":" Seems silly but are you sure it is in the unlocked position? When in the locked position the lever part is at the unlocked arrow. You have to press down and move the selector the direction of the arrow in order for it to unlock. When unlocked the Lever should be at nearly a 45degree angle and free to bobble back and forth when touched. When locked the handle doesn't move even when pressed or pulled.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the paper size adjustable to put 7 holes in 5.5 x8.5 daily planner pages?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know the answer put would suspect not because I believe there are only 3 pegs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this paper have a detectable texture? I am currently using Epson Ultrasmooth--how does the Velvet surface compare?\n Answer:","completion":" It is not a smooth surface at all. But does not show texture. If you haven't tried it, please do so. My prints are beautiful on this paper and are perfect for galleries or museums.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have the Epson watermark imprinted all over the back? I need both sides blank....\n Answer:","completion":" There is no watermark but the directions recommend only printing on one side\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Epson Printer: What epson printer can be used with this product?\n Answer:","completion":" Check Epson's website. I know it does work with my Stylus Pro 3880 printer. Also check the paper profiles that came with your printer by clicking on PRINt. The papers that work with your printer will be in the media portion of the dialogue box.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: when using on a canon pima pro 100 which profile should i select?\n Answer:","completion":" See if you can find a custom profile. You can also try photo rag it might give you simular results.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can other photo quality printers be used with this paper?\n Answer:","completion":" I use it with my Canon Pixma Pro100 with excellent results...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: which side is best to print on?\n Answer:","completion":" I buy Velvet for the front side - duh! Why do you care if you print on the back? There are cheaper, quality Epson papers for printing other things.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many sheets are in this pack?\n Answer:","completion":" 20 sheets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the weight (mil) or GSM of each sheet?\n Answer:","completion":" 19 mil\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why so expensive??? Why does it cost so much more from this shop???\n Answer:","completion":" From Epson you pay full retail price, unless they're having a sale on this particlar paper (RARE!). Price here on Amazon is less than $50.00. I'm going to place another order for it later today from Amazon.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: amount? How many sheets are there in this box?\n Answer:","completion":" Mr. Showers was helpful to answer, however his answer was ....WRONG! Unfortunately I based my purchase on his wrong answer. :-( The correct answer is that there are 20 sheets of 13 x 19 in the box of Velvet Fine Art paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this paper in an inkjet printer as opposed to a laser printer?\n Answer:","completion":" yes I've used it in both types of printers, love this paper\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Which side do you print on? Both sides are the same in \"whiteness\/brightness\" and one side has slightly more \"tooth\" ? I am puzzled?\n Answer:","completion":" One side only not both. The side that is textured so your print looks great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm a bit confused by the dimensions -- the title reads \"8.5x11\" while the product details read \"11.5 x 9 x 0.5\". Is that larger size just the box?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes..the box..I bought paper it is 8.5. X. 11\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know what the weight of this paper is?\n Answer:","completion":" The paper is 260 g\/m2. I would describe it like a watercolor paper weight. It can compare to a business card thickness. I found this description for you from a printer online: 260gsm(g\/m2) premium paper - heavy weight, our thickest paper for our poster printing service. This paper is considerably thicker and more hard wearing than the thinnest budget paper. This can be likened to the thickness of magazine covers, nearing the feel and rigidness of thin card, but would still fold easily if required.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what color is the actual paper?\n Answer:","completion":" It is a flat black and white paper similar to matt surface papers for darkroom printing. I did not like it as it was not \"velvet\" black at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would this work on an Epson Artisan 710?\n Answer:","completion":" I used it in an Xp-610 and the results were excellent. The 610 does have adjustments for the thickness of the paper stock.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used in a non-Epson printer (HP or Lexmark)?\n Answer:","completion":" I print on the Epson Velvet Fine Art Paper using a Canon Pixma Printer (ink jet) and it prints beautifully on either side of the Velvet Fine Art Paper. The side that I print on depends on if the print is to be used as a notecard where one might use a fountain pen. Side A of the Velvet Fine Art Paper has more sizing to keep the fountain pen from wicking.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this paper be use on the CANON PIXMA MG5620?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure what the results would be. Usually papers of this quality are designed for the Epson's printers, as paper of similar quality are designed for the Canon printers. I would suggest that you consider using Canon paper with the Canon printer, just look for a matte paper that is considered fine art paper.

{"prompt":"Question: Using inkjet printer ink, does the ink fade if it's wet? I want to make baby books and would hate to have baby slobber the words off.\n Answer:","completion":" What a neat use for the fabric sheets! We really didn't know, so we applied two tests. First we spit on it, imitating a baby as best we could. It didn't run. We then held it under running water for a minute or so and rubbed it vigorously. Again, it didn't run. However, the label we tested was printed a couple weeks ago, so the inkjet ink had plenty of time to dry. We think you'd be safe in printing the baby books -- good luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I printed as directed and then waited 24 hours. It seems like the dry ink is smearing. Should I Scotchgard?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Mary! We had no problem with smearing, but it was probably a week later that I spit on it and tried to smear it. You might try that first.

{"prompt":"Question: My 8 thread Baby Lock recently broke and i am desperate to get a replacement. Will I be satisfied with the Brother 1034D? I have a Brother Inovis an\n Answer:","completion":" Going from a Baby Lock to a Brother will be a little bit of a shock. The Baby Lock is certainly smoother than the 1034D will ever be and more than likely you had more options on your 8 thread Babylock. With that being said, I really like my Brother 1034 D and have not had any of the issues that have been discussed in the neg reviews. I have also used a Singer Serger and must say that my machine threads amazingly in comparison to the Singer! I also have not had nearly as many broken threads as I have on the Singer. I am glad I bought this product and have been using it for 18 months now.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: use as a sewing machine\n Answer:","completion":" Depends what you are sewing, if it is seams, yes but for regular sewing no. Kind of like a microwave and a kitchen oven. A microwave is fast but the food texture is different than in a oven. So, it is nice to have both\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this machine as regular sewing machine to stitch some fabric up?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes,I have used it to sew a quilt top together because it stitches a seam and overlocks at the same time. It is especially good for knit fabric. :-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have never serged before, I need a very simple to thread machine. any suggestions for me?\n Answer:","completion":" Izzy, if you can thread a sewing machine, you can thread this machine. I carefully followed the directions in the booklet and to my surprise I got it on the first try. I also took the beginning serger class on Craftsy.com which helped. The difficulty with threading the machine is tight space. But with the tweezers its manageable. I would do it when you have an hour of uninterrupted time to concentrate on it the task at hand. Then go step by step. I never used a serger before. I was very leery when I started, but it was easier than I thought. I think this is a good basic machine for beginning to use a serger. I made a simple knit skirt using the serger. It was fast and I got a good result. I really recommend the Craftsy class which I watched prior to using my machine. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size cones should I buy? I want to get this for my wife as a Christmas gift along with an assortment of thread so it's \"ready to go\".

{"prompt":"Question: Does this finish the edge and gather at the same time or do you have to sew two separate times.\n Answer:","completion":" It will do both at the same time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am very beginner at sewing and I am wanting to make blankets, dresses, taggies, etc, would this or a regular sewing machine be best?\n Answer:","completion":" I sew too and if you are a true beginner I would suggest you start out with a regular sewing machine. You can do everything with a sewing machine where as a serger can do a lot BUT you would still need a sewing machine for some projects. Everything you mentioned you can use a sewing machine on. In fact, some sewing machine even has a \"serger or a coverlock' stitch on it which could eliminate a serger completely. Once you get comfortable with sewing a few things then you can add a serger in but you can sew the rest of your life with a sewing machine and still produce high quality results without ever buying a serger. Be warned:sewing can be addictive lol. If you need any advice about sewing or finding patterns then look me up on facebook and I can give you some group links just for sewing and getting encouragement just starting out.

{"prompt":"Question: How many small, palm sized \"worry stones\" do you think I could get out of one of these multi packs?\n Answer:","completion":" If you're talking about a quarter size stone, you'd get dozens. My guess would be 4-6 per color rectangle depending on the size of each stone. I bought 2 packs for my grandkids. They've molded cookies the size of a quarter, pies, mario, dinosaurs, etc. and haven't yet used up half of 1 multi-pack. Hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Once I cure it in the oven, how hard is the finished product? Can I use the finished item in a sand casting mold? (I will need to tap w\/ a hammer)\n Answer:","completion":" the reason I use poly clay is because it doesn't harden like molding clay. It becomes firm, you can'f adjust shape, but it is plyable enough that it doesn't break if i drop it. It will break if you put too much pressure on it. A lot would depend on how fine of pieces are you making. If it i a long piece that is only 1\/8 th inch it may not work..but if its a piece that is 1\/2 inch or more I would think you won't have problems.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can the oven which baked this clay still be used to bake food?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes we have had no ill effects\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it come with the charms or anything to be made out of the clay?\n Answer:","completion":" It does not come with any charms, but is an excellent deal for the amount of clay you are getting. To make things out of the clay you do not need anything extra unless you want it. If you choose to use it for jewelry making you will need fastenings and such, I use it for making things to go in fairy gardens and as such have no need for any little extra things.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a broken oven that won't be fixed for a really, really long time. Trust me. What do I do?\n Answer:","completion":" I would not recommend microwaving this! I gave some of this to a friend of mine and she put it in the microwave after I told her I would not do it. We smelled this awful stench and it had melted and caught on fire in the microwave. It destroyed the clay and the brand new microwave. The house smelled like burnt chemicals for a long time after. So please, please do not try it in the microwave!!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to try this as an project for a class. I have 17 kids. I was thinking they would make a mini project.

{"prompt":"Question: Where is it made?\n Answer:","completion":" According to what I found online... \"Sculpey is a brand of polymer clay made by Polyform Products in the United States. Sculpey was first created in the early 1960s. The original idea was to use the clay as a thermal transfer compound; this would conduct heat away from the cores of electrical transformers. However, the compound was not successful for this use so it was pushed to the side for a while. In the late 1960s it was then discovered that this compound could be molded, baked, sanded, drilled, carved and painted. This was a perfect medium for the craft industry. The clay was marketed directly to people at craft shows, street fairs and demonstrations in small art stores.\" Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: which brand of dry erase marker should be used on this product to easily erase?\n Answer:","completion":" To be honest, I haven't had a problem with any brand including dollars stores. Eventually it will get dirty like any whiteboard so i end I end up cleaning with that expo solvent stuff but the important thing is to figure out which side is the erasable side and which is not. Sounds like it would be obvious but I've mixed them up twice now so check before you use the paper!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you stick these to windows? Also, I'm unclear whether or not they are easy to clean...take the writing off? Thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" I stuck them to my classroom window. The writing never wants to wipe off, so I ended up moving it to the backside of the window to write on the glass and have a white backing. The rest are a waste. It's impossible to wipe off the dry erase. Maybe a wet erase marker will work better.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these rehang easily after multiple uses and do they stick well to glass?\n Answer:","completion":" They are extremely thin (think saran wrap thin, I didn't believe it myself until I got mine) and I have found the surface raises where you have written so they are really not good for multiple uses. I find they tear very easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just want to be sure that these will easily remove from most surfaces. Also, would it be possible to print on them if sized to fit printer?\n Answer:","completion":" Wendy, they stick to the wall because of static. They remove super easily. I've never tried the printer option.\n"}

So what does?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought the Expo package with the cleaning solution and it worked excellent. Writes well and wipe everything off completely.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would the writing come off too easily to keep and store them until we are ready to re-use them?\n Answer:","completion":" I think the writing would stay one pretty well. It may depend on the marker you use. The ones I use take elbow-grease and alcohol to come clean, which means the writing is semi-permanent until I rub the daylights out of it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what kind of pens should I use\n Answer:","completion":" Any Dry Erase Marker should work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi - it is unclear if all 35 sheets add up to 27\"x34\" or if each sheet is 27\"x34\"\n Answer:","completion":" Each sheet is 27'X34\". They are great.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this frame come unfinished? If so then can you tell me where to get finished one?\n Answer:","completion":" They come both finished and unfinished (I highly suggest getting the pre-finished one or staining it yourself before first use). You can get any size or finish directly from graceframe.com. The Fruitwood finish costs an additional $100 (I just checked their website). You can get really good, detailed pictures of the frame and options that are available on www.sewingmachinesplus.com. The best price is from Amazon, but I don't see a pre-stained finish option.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I want to create stickers that can then be used by other people. Does this just apply adhesive or is it adhesive and a backing like a normal sticker?\n Answer:","completion":" There is an adhesive backing on your homemade sticker, but it won't cut around the image as a regular sticker is punched out. So you'll have extra adhesive on a square paper around the image. Once you peel off the backing that all will come off with it, and you are left with the sticky image. I hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have 3 5\" 5\"Creative Station Refill Cartridges (2 permanent and 1 repositionable). Will they work as well in the XRN510 machine.\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure I understand what you are asking. Are you saying that you have three 5 1\/2 inch refill cartridges? The refill cartridges have to match the particular machine you have. For instance you cannot put a 1 inch refill into a 5 inch Xyron. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How crystal clear is the permanent and repositionable adhesive? Is the acid-free adhesive crystal clear?\n Answer:","completion":" There is no way to tell. The adhesive is bonded to the back of the item to be stuck down. It is clear but probably not crystal. It is acid free.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use this with cutouts from my Cricut machine. Does this make a full sheet or will it just stick to the parts that remain after cutting?\n Answer:","completion":" It only sticks to the parts that remain after cutting. I thought the same thing and watched a few youtube videos before buying to understand better. Try looking it up on youtube.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could I laminate it then turn it into a sticker so I can stick it on bags and such and not have to worry about water?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if it would become waterproof or not but it will definitely stick. There are different types of adhesives. I have permanent (non-repositional) and it adheres very well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work for taking images I have printed and cut out for stickers.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. You can either cut out the images first, or insert a 5\" piece of paper with the image(s) on it and cut out after the adhesive has been applied. They have both a permanent and a repositionable adhesive available. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: So you can switch between the different types of rolls (magnet, adhesive, laminate\/adhesive, etc) without any problems?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they just slide in and out very easy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the back waist length adjustable? And if so, anyone know what the range is?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is! However, my dress form arrived damaged and I never exchanged it, but the threads won't catch anymore on the back adjustment dial. So I have to adjust the other three dials until it's the correct size.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What materials are the adjustment gears made of.\n Answer:","completion":" Plastic gears they work fine though. The spaces to adjust are large, so it makes pinning a bit hard. It's worked good for what I've done so far\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the upper body length adjustable? (I am not talking about height I am talking about upper body length)\n Answer:","completion":" This one can stretch about a couple of inches longer in the torso. The Dritz Twin Fit can stretch from 15 inches, up to 19 or 20 inches in the torso.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the pole off center so that you can work on pants\n Answer:","completion":" The pole is not off center so you cannot work on pants.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it work on jeans?\n Answer:","completion":" in my opinion, no! i used it on a pair of lightweight dress pants and 1x in the wash, they came completely apart!! i know i did it right. i have used hem tape many times before. do yourself a favor. opt for the heavy duty stuff. this is a joke.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it easy to take off?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say that it's relatively easy. In my case after 3 or 4 washing-drying cycles the hem (which is what we used this for) started falling apart in some sections. From there it was easy to take it off and apply a new layer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you stitch over this? I'm confused by all these witchery, web, and wonder-under.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you can stitch over the stich witchery once you get it ironed on!!! For example if you say...were making a lined panel (curtain) then you would iron on SW to your desired returns (hem line) according to the printed instructions on back of packaging on both the face fabric and the linining fabric then the next step would be to stitch both pieces of fabric together! So you would have had to stiched over the SW!!! It will not affect your sewing machine needle in any way....if this was what you were worried about! Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work well to shorter curtain? My apartment windows are 73 inches tall, but that's a hard length to find...\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! I used it to make no sew curtains and it bonded great. Just make sure to use wet towel and hold it for 10 secs. I used on cotton too..very pleased\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this make a strong enough bond that it'd withstand a 3 yr old? I saw a tutorial for a new-sew skirt made out of it, but I'm unsure about it.\n Answer:","completion":" It is very strong when applied properly.

{"prompt":"Question: how does this product work do you have to put it into something to get the pattern?\n Answer:","completion":" Slide the paper into the slot and push down like a hole punch. I got the wrong size when I ordered...thought it would be larger...too small for my use.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it dry right away when you heatgun the embossing powder?\n Answer:","completion":" I have never had any problem with it drying. The issue is that you HAVE to make sure all of the embossing powder has melted when you hit it with the heat gun - and be aware that it takes the heat gun a moment or two to heat up... just because it's blowing doesn't mean it's hot enough. Once it has warmed up, and your embossing powder is on there, it should \"dry\" (harden is a better word) within 10 seconds.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this good to use I fabric and is it permanent ?\n Answer:","completion":" I only use it on paper. My instinct tells me it would not work on fabric since it smears even after I've let it dry overnight (and it would probably smear when washed). But maybe some one else has had success.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will the etch remain after the glass gets wet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the etching is permenant and will remain if it gets wet. I did have to leave the product on for quite a while for it to have the etching effect I wanted. I applied several coats as well and left each one on for about 30 minutes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: there are no directions ?\n Answer:","completion":" There are directions on the bottle, follow them precisely. This is best for crafting images onto glass.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Did anyone use this to remove the anti-reflective coating from the high index 1.71 -1.74 lenses?\n Answer:","completion":" This product is NOT FOR CLEANING GLASSES. It is for etching designs into glass.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will This product etch acrylic wine glasses?\n Answer:","completion":" I have no doubt it will but I can't say for sure. I bought it to remove the coating on my eyeglasses, which I can say does NOT do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many projects can you do with 3 oz.?\n Answer:","completion":" Depends on what size the projects are, but you can do quite a few. So far I've etched a smallish design (2x3\") on 3 glasses and I've still got most of the bottle left.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: directions for use ?\n Answer:","completion":" Get a small paint brush and apply a thick coat to both sides of your glasses. Leave it for about 45 minutes and then rinse it off. If it doesn't get everything off the first time, repeat the process\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: glasses\n Answer:","completion":" I bought this product to remove the anti glare film from my glasses. It did exactly that. Put it on and left it 45 minutes and rinsed them off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need the 1\/16 in. circles that are punched out for a project. How well are the circles preserved after being punched? Are they mangled or deformed\n Answer:","completion":" No, actually they remain intact...I hadn't even thought about it until you asked. I find the regular size holes often get a little bent, but I didn't find that with these.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone tried using this on leather? For example, adding an additional hole to an adjustable purse strap...\n Answer:","completion":" It would be hard to use this on leather. This is more for paper. They sell leather punches on Amazon. (I bought one)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the reach on this and the distance between the holes? I need my holes 1.25\" from the top of the paper.\n Answer:","completion":" I just measured mine, it's 2\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are you able to see through top of hole punch so that can line up hole exactly?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, from the front you are able to in my opinion. It cuts perfectly and the hole is perfect size for stringing a string or two to attach to a cookie as a favour which is why I purchased it for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this works with bottle caps?\n Answer:","completion":" I am assuming your talking about metal bottle caps. I say try at your own risk. This is used for paper, construction paper and thin leather\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this punch suitable for making earring cards...particularly the fish hook earrings?\n Answer:","completion":" J. Williams, I would think it would work just fine. I used mine for the smallest hole that I could thread an elastic thread through on a product card. The card is only about 1 1\/2 inch square, so it was important not to have something any bigger than the thread....and leaving room for the information on the card. It might be worth giving it a try. I just grabbed one of my cards and some earrings. It is not a tight fit. But, with the shape of the 'hook,' they don't just fall off if the card is twisted and turned. I also looked at a earring card that was still in my jewelry box. It is the exact hole size of this card for post type earrings. Hope this helps, Linda\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this work with small brads?\n Answer:","completion":" It punches a 1\/16\" hole which is great for small brads. If your brad is a little larger than the hole, it still will make a hole to start the brad through the paper. I very much like this punch. It does a great job.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would the 1\/16 inch version punch holes through cardboard and towards the center of a 8.5 by 5.5 in page?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not understand your question, sorry!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is the listing titled : \"Bulk Buy: Lily Sugar'n Cream Yarn Twists Super Size (6-Pack)\" if it is only for 1 skein? Misleading!!!\n Answer:","completion":" You got me. I just know it pays to read the fine print before you order any thing... I always check the ratings on items from other buyers before I purchase as well. Sorry I can not be more helpful.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Yes, knowing the weight, category &amp; fiber content would be VERY helpful. Why is there no description?\n Answer:","completion":" I agree and no one ever answered my question. I like the yarn and the colors and it did a great job but I never knew if I would have enough.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many yards?\n Answer:","completion":" 68 yards of yarn per skein\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the price of $3.97 for 6 balls of yarn?\n Answer:","completion":" no just one\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the thickness of each slat and the distance between each slat? I am thinking of using this for something other than quilt rulers.\n Answer:","completion":" The distance between each slat is very close to 5\/8 of an inch!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My rulers are of different thickness. What is keeping the rulers from sliding out the bottom when the ruler holder is hanging on the wall?\n Answer:","completion":" The holder that I got from Amazon is not the one you can hang on the wall. Mine sits on the cutting table. I do have one that hangs on the wall. The difference in the two is the one that sits on the cutting table has grooves straight up and down and the one that I have on the wall has diagonal grooves and I got it at the quilt show. Just be sure that it says it can be hung on the wall. My rulers are different sizes too and they fit in both of them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Have you ever tried to stand playing cards inbetween the slats? Im thinking about using this for that purpose. How do you think that'd work? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Just tried it...works fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a stash of Olfa blades - will they work with the Martelli Ergo 2000 cutter?\n Answer:","completion":" I am assuming that they do, but I haven't tried it. I haven't had my Martelli cutter for very long -- perhaps a month. I was planning to call Martelli and ask if they work with other brands of cutters. The reason I wanted to know is that I have a bunch of Olfa blades that I might be able to use on the Martelli cutter. I'd suggest you watch the video on the Martelli cutter on the Martelli site. It is very good, and certainly teaches how to use a rotary cutter properly. Martelli makes the very best products. I have several of them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: has anyone purchased this recently? Did you receive the updated version with the thumb and forefinger guides?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased 2 in March and yes they have the indentations for your thumb and forefinger.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: it states easy clean tab - how does it open to clean out the black accumulation\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Bonnie, if you look at the cutter with the blade and screw side towards you you can see a clear tab above the screw. Make sure your blade is closed, remove the screw turning counter clockwise and then the clear tab can be seen right underneath the screw hole. You push the tab towards the area where the blade opens. I wanted to send you a picture of the instructions but I can't attach it. If you want to you can email me at terryr915@yahoo.com. Terry\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this model the most current one? They made changes in 2012? I am wondering why it is almost half the price as the one on the Martelli website.\n Answer:","completion":" Because they only list the retail price. No one actually sells it for that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a difference from the red handle vs black handle? This picture doesn't show the front of it? I want one took take the pressure of my thum\n Answer:","completion":" Bertha, the difference in colors is handedness. The red cutter is shaped for righthanded folks, the black is the reverse angle for left handed folks. And, btw, it really does work! Their rotary cutting mat is excellent, too.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: So, has anyone tried using an Olfa blade on the Martelli Ergocutter yet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yep, and it will NOT work. This version of the Martelli cutter uses a blade with a smooth circle in the middle, not the notched like the Olfa. The earlier Martelli cutters did use the usual notched blades, but not the new one. I don't know if there is a \"model\" # or something like that to tell the difference between the old and the new versions. That said, I wouldn't be able to cut fabric if I used anything else, so I switched to the smooth circle blades. :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where to purchase it\n Answer:","completion":" How about right here on Amazon? I got mine from here with no problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these the old style or new style cutters? I am looking for the old style\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, but I don't know. I do like it and it is the first one I have had.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 45mm vs. 60 mm? I've never used a rotary cutter. I'd mostly be cutting patterns (if it works for that) and bias strips. Which size would be better?\n Answer:","completion":" My \"go-to\" cutter is the 45mm. The 45mm is easier to use for pattern cutting and I feel easier to control. A new blade can easily cut from 4 to 6 layers of fabric. The 60mm is great for cutting layers of 6 or more and great for straight cuts. Any rotary cutter works best with straight cuts and in conjunction with a rotary ruler and mat. Hope this answers your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to temporarily adhere a badge to a shirt for a Halloween costume. Would this spray work for that?\n Answer:","completion":" It would! But it makes a pretty good mess when spraying and a pricey buy for just that. A little bit of Elmer's White School Glue (which is like $1) heat set with a hot dry iron will work super good, plus is totally water soluble :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work to cover a mirrored closet door with fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure the smooth surface of the mirror would create enough \"grab\", oddly enough you know what might work well is good old fashioned water soluble glue sticks, I use them a lot in my sewing, they hold well and are easy to clean up, plus cheaper :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Our 505 spray is still sticky after many washes. What cleans it off?\n Answer:","completion":" I use it all the time while machine embroidering (to attach the stabilizer to the fabric when i dont hoop it) and what works for me is warm water if the fabric can take it. even hot water will do it faster\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this on poly\/cotton blend? Will it launder out completely? How long does it hold?\n Answer:","completion":" This product is used by sewers as a temporary fixative only. Yes, it will wash out completely.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking for something to stick large temporary appliques to marching band uniforms. Will this wash out completely with warm water?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it should. I have never had a problem with it---just be sure to spray the back of the temporary applique, not the band uniform itself.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this product do for stamp cross stitching after youn done do you spray on the back to make it not coming back\n Answer:","completion":" I do not understand your question exactly, but let me tell you how I use this product. It is as temporary adhesive and I use it layering my quilting, i.e., backing, spray, batting, spray and then the top. This holds the layers together so I can quilt either by hand or machine. I launder my quilt before using. If, however, it is a wall hanging,I usually do not launder. It is an adhesive not intended to remove the ink from pre-stamped embroidery.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this work on felt? Especially when using in an embroidery machine?\n Answer:","completion":" I love the 505 spray because it does not gum up the sewing machine needle. Because the felt is such a porous surface you can use it but spray both the felt and the stabilizer ... let them sit for about 30 seconds and then press them together. Another option would be to get some of the stabilizer than has a tacky surface. The tacky surface stabilizer will allow you to reposition and or use a piece of felt or fabric that is smaller than your hoop but large enough for the design you wish to embroider (by machine).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much area does one can cover? To baste a queen sized quilt between the three layers how many cans are needed? Thanks in advance!\n Answer:","completion":" you spray lightly so you can get several quilts from one can. Spray fast and lightly. If you give it a heavy spray you will gunk up your machine. Be sure to spray the fabric NOT the batting. The batting will really absorb the spray.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I see three different weights for this can. Is this the large can, or the small can?\n Answer:","completion":" The small can.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi there, i want to use this to stick a paper on a polyester surface for sublimation; to avoid movement when i close the heat press. Will it work?\n Answer:","completion":" It will stick, but, i am unfamiliar with the process you are using\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions? This has been asked before but no answer.\n Answer:","completion":" The bag is quite roomy - just shy of 14\" high, about 12 1\/2\" side to side and about 11 3\/4\" front to back. I have a Baby Lock Eclipse that fits in it with room to spare.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you give me the measurements? have a new Serger and it is larger than my old one...\n Answer:","completion":" across the top front to back it is 11\" sides are front to back 11\" and width side to side is about 13\". Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will a Bernina 1150MDA fit in this case. Is the bottom of the case solid or supported in any way\n Answer:","completion":" There is a solid piece in the bottom that should be strong enough to support the serger. Not sure what size your serger is but mine is a Janome 4 thread and fits in easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: size: what are the dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a Janome 1200D serger will this fit? It is a 5 thread serger.Thank you\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the dimensions? I see that this question has previously been asked, but I don't see the answer.\n Answer:","completion":" It is 15\"H x 21\"W x 10\"D, I can fit my 24 yr old Singer Ultra Unlimited sewing machine, a power strip, small fan, accessory box inside the large compartment. Plus extra scissors, needles and my Nook in the outside pocket.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are deimensions\n Answer:","completion":" 20 x 9 1\/2 x 16\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work as an airline carry-on?\n Answer:","completion":" You would have to ask the TSA. You would not be allowed to carry your scissors it rotary cutters in it. The sides are soft so I would not trust it to be checked with a machine in it. I use mine mostly to take my machine to the school to help sew flags and uniforms for field band\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will a Bernina 780 fit in this bag?\n Answer:","completion":" Most machines fit into the bags sold.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Janome Memory Craft 9900 Sewing and Embroidery Machine. Will this bag accommodate it and the Embroidery attachment?\n Answer:","completion":" My machine is a Brother SQ9185, not so fancy but it has the quilting arm attachment. The interior dimensions of the bag are 20x15x9 if that helps. I have space for fabric and supplies above my machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of wheels does it have?\n Answer:","completion":" It has plastic wheels that work ok, but break with too much weight in case.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size is it?\n Answer:","completion":" Most sewing machines will fit, Singer, Kenmore, Brother and some of the smaller Janome and Bernina. Watch out as the handles on these aren't the best.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the interior dimensions\n Answer:","completion":" 20 inches wide, 8 inches deep; 15 inches high. Hope this helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to know the internal dimensions. I have a brother PE780D It measures 11.42H x 17.32W x 7.87D\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, I have no information about such a machine or dimensions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this bulb (Singer Long Life Light Bulb 15 Watt-120 Volt-Push-In Base) fit a 1950s Singer sewing machine model number AL338437?\n Answer:","completion":" I would venture to say most likely if it is a 15 watt 120 volt push in base. I purchased it for my 80 plus year old Aunt's older machine and she was thrilled she did not have to drive and look for the bulb and it was delivered to her doorstep in 2 days. It certainly was cheap enough to buy over the internet and save her the cost of gas.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this fit in a huskvarna 630?\n Answer:","completion":" It depends entirely on the base type, I think, if yours is a push in base bulb, I'm sure this will work, I think the only other type of sewing machine bulb is the screw in type, or that's the only other I know of!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this work for a Bernina machine that calls for a 12v 5 watt pushin bulb? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" I have a Pfaff and it works great for me. My concern was since it was a push in that the nibs on the side might be too big or too small or too fat or something along that line. It turned out to be a non problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this bulb fit a singer 288?\n Answer:","completion":" It seems to be standard size vintage sewing machine with a bayonette type sockets. The newer ones have a screw on bulb. I used a refrigerator bulp on those. I hope that helps you. Happiness!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these guys ship to the UK?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes we will ship to the UK. Thank you Yards N Yarn\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this bulb fit an Elna Lotus SP (35)?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure. I do know that bayonet type light bulbs for sewing machine are standard and if your elna lotus sp requires a bayonet type light bulb base then it might fit. I hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it fit a featherweight? old machine\n Answer:","completion":" If it has the same bayonet type slot on it, it probably will. If its a thread on system you can use the refrigerator light bulb. You can also bring the worn out bulb to walmart\/ joann's to see if it will match your featherweight's light bulb. My oldest sewing machine is from the 50s an the singer light bulb is what I used for it. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this work with Columbia fleece?\n Answer:","completion":" The fleece has no bearing on the parts you may need replaced zippers are metal, plastic or nylon and that's what should match to the repair kit. . I am assuming the zipper you have in the fleece vest or jacket is plastic #5 for which the metal kit may not be what you are looking for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Slider is broken on a jacket with a small tooth nylon zipper. How do I get the new slider onto the already sewn on zipper?\n Answer:","completion":" If the top stop is a small metal clip, then it can be pried apart with a small screwdriver and clamped back after with a pair of needle nose pliers. If the top stop is a molded nylon stop, then use a file or a pair of diagonal cutters to get rid of the little nubs that prevent the slider from coming off. After, use a small knife to cut a little groove on the side of the top stop and then use needle and thread to wrap a few lines around the stop. This will serve the same function as the removed nubs. Follow with a drop of Krazy Glue on the thread to harden it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it inclued no7 size\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think so. The product description lists what sizes it comes with.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the stops parts to repair the bottom stop for a coat that separates included, end pieces that feed into pull on both sides fixed and feed in?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure what you are asking, but yes there are end pieces\/stops included.

{"prompt":"Question: I need a large zipper for a heavy jacket with a separating zipper Will this have one large enough for my need?\n Answer:","completion":" There is at least one large zipper head, however, it will also depend on what size you are seeking.If I recall the size head was for a #5 brass zipper, which will do in a pinch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My bag has no stops. can I still use this?\n Answer:","completion":" No, these only work with stops.\n"}

You can find 'pull' replacements on line or in a fabric store.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know if this will this work on a north face jacket..i have no idea what kind of zipper it has...tia...curtis\n Answer:","completion":" There are several different size zippers in the kit.

I was very satisfied with the kit and was able to repair a favorite jacket of mine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this repair kit work on metal zippers?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I have used this repair kit on a couple of zippers now, both metal and nylon, and it is really easy to use, has easy to follow instructions and is well worth the money for the garments I have saved.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you replace the blade on this unit?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you can replace the blade in this saw. The Bahco blade is held in to the handle with a large Philips screw on the locking button side, and a locking nut in a captive slot on the reverse side. I haven't seen the exact blade used in the Laplander saw listed separately for sale here in the US, but it's a common replacement overseas, especially in Europe. NOTE: The 396HP blade is for the 396HP 7-1\/2\" saw, the 396JT blade is for the 396JT Japanese Tooth style saw. Both of these blades are NOT the original blade for the 396-LAP 8\" Laplander saw.

{"prompt":"Question: How would this compare to the Corona RS 10\" folding pruning saw?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't used that saw, but I've heard good things about it too. I watched a comparison of many folding saws competing on the same log, and the Laplander consistently outperformed the others. My experience has been very positive. My wife even starting batoning with the saw blade (she saw me baton with a knife) and I quickly asked her to stop when I made it back to camp. I thought the blade would be destroyed, but it was fine. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it cut both forward &amp; back?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it cut deer antlers? I need to split antlers for my dogs because it's too big.\n Answer:","completion":" It will but you know that's not what it ment for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the hardened? Is it designed to be resharpen-able?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it can be sharpened. Can;t imagine anyone having a saw & not having a file to sharpen it! Let me get this right. Everyone is saying that when you are out camping and you'e cutting a piece of wood and rake the teeth across a piece of wire, or nail, or bullet in the wood and dull the blade that you are supposed to stop and spend 2 weeks to get a new blade? Get a file and waste a whole 10 minutes and re-sharpen it:)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Any way to tell when the blade needs replaced? Mine seems to be cutting slower now but it hasn't been used much at all. Could be the type of wood but I'm just not sure.\n Answer:","completion":" As long as the points and edges of the teeth still feel sharp, you should be ok. As with any tool, the brand new sharpness will slightly go away. As long as the kerf is still correct and the teeth feel sharp to the touch it should just be normal wear. Keep in mind there is always the possibility of using a file to sharpen the blade and keep extending the life of the saw without replacement.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the blade rugged,unlike flimsy ones that bend and eventually break?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a fairly sturdy gauge. I went through about a dozen good-sized branches and then all of the trimming cuts to get them down to manageable, trailer-sized pieces, probably 40 in total, without any bending. You would have to really misuse the tool to damage it, I would think. It's good quality - Snap-On tools either owns the company or actually makes the product. It is worth the money in my opinion.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: had great experiences cutting pine very quickly. Has anyone been able to use this on deer to cut open the brisket.

{"prompt":"Question: Would this machine work with a newer PC running windows vista operating system or higher?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it will but if it is a 64 bit you will have to purchase an upgrade program.

{"prompt":"Question: Hello, is there an expiring date on this paper once the package is open?\n Answer:","completion":" There is no expiration date printed on the package. However, if you store it in a cool, dry, dark area, it will stay fresher longer. Your best bet is to seal it in an airtight container. Moisture will cause it to warp. I have had my package for a couple months now (I store it sealed in a large ziplock bag), and haven't noticed a change in flavor, although it seems the more handling I do, the more likely the edges are to crumble.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use that paper with Fondant cakes? how do I stick them to the cake in this case after it is printed with an image?\n Answer:","completion":" It's perfect for fondant cakes.

{"prompt":"Question: Can this paper be used with rubber stamps and edible ink for cupcake decorations\n Answer:","completion":" I have successfully done this, you have to make sure and not use a lot of ink, I lightly blot the stamp on a paper towel to remove excess ink.

{"prompt":"Question: is this product good for babies? my 5 month old likes to chew on paper\n Answer:","completion":" The paper is made from starch and it's consumption should be limited in any way you would limit starch in your infants diet. Starches are polysacharides and are broken down into sugars which might be problematic if your child were diabetic, depending on the quantity eaten. If you intend on writing on the \"paper\" consideration should be given to possible toxicity of the inks you might be using. The paper dissolves quickly on the tongue in small quantities. Larger quantities might form a gluey mass and pose a choking hazard (as would regular paper).\n"}

I usually to my inlay with 1\/16\" - 1\/8\" really just all depends on how deep you are cutting in to the material. I usually use a car bid parting tool to make it a perfect square cut into the wood.

{"prompt":"Question: I am new to the inlay world and would be using it with wood wall art. Can you help me understand how I would set this powder in place?

{"prompt":"Question: How does this compare to the constant heat burners? I am wondering if this machine allows for more heat or is it just to control heat at lower temperatures?\n Answer:","completion":" the higher you turn the dial the hotter it gets\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What pen does it come with?\n Answer:","completion":" A skew tip pen. It basically is a knife. Buy the pen where you can replace the tip through razertip and the tips you need. They have more tips on their site than Amazon. Make sure to do it all at once I remember the shipping adds about $10.You'll definitely need to buy more pens and maybe another cord since it comes with only one. I actually regret not saving money by going with the single burner. The dual burner only is different by flipping a switch rather than unplugging and plugging in other pens.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with any tips\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with one standard skew pen which is great for outlines and feathers, I would recommend finding a shading pen as well, you can find many different pens as well as an interchangeable pen by razertip, It is compatible with many other brand pens as well as long as you have the correct cords.\n"}

I am buying this for someone who carves various animals out of ironwood and mesquite. he wants to use the burner for the finer detail work.\n Answer:","completion":" it comes with one tip. for him i would recommend skew tip,a medium or small spoon shader and various size ball tips. You can get the interchangeable tip and get several sizes of ball tips for it. the shader i would recommend buying the pen not a interchangeable tip and the same with the skew.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need a tip that creates a hairline burn. Would the create a tip pen work to do this?\n Answer:","completion":" The Create-a-Tip puts down a fairly heavy line. The Large Skew that comes with the burner does fine straight lines and for fine curved lines I would recommend the Medium Round tip.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Example of how to hold scissors for proper sharpening?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Darlene: The directions are on the back of the package. If you are right handed, hold the sharpener in your left hand with your thumb in the front and your index finger in the back. You will see that there are two circular indentations on each side. Hold the sharpener with the open notch pointing upward. Hold your scissors in your right hand, slip the lower blade into the lower slot, and rest the upper blade in the open notch. Now squeeze the handles together as if you would to cut something and pull toward your scissors towards you at the same time. Insert, squeeze and pull. Repeat that several times. I am left handed and can sharpen my left-handed scissors holding the sharpener in my right hand and the scissors in my left hand and this works for right or left handed scissors. The only time it could get complicated is if you have an older pair of left handed scissors with right-handed blades. In this case you would have to hold the scissors in your right hand and the sharpener in the left hand. And yes, I still have my first pair of left handed Fiskars dressmaking shears from the early 60's, that have right handed blades! After using this sharpener on my oldest pair of Fiskars, it is sharper than my three newer Fiskar dressmaking shears. Okay, so let's say you don't like the squeezing action. There is another way to sharpen the blades. Holding the scissors, open the blades and slip one blade into the lower slot and slide the sharpener back and forward along the blade several times. Flip the scissors over and repeat with the other blade. In this case you are not moving the scissors, but simply the sharpener, sliding it to and fro. You will see that the scissor blades are cut at an angle and the ceramic pin is inserted at an angle. So align the angle of your blade with the angle of the ceramic pin. I hope this helps. E-me back and let me know how you do. - Angela\n"}

That was the primary reason I bought it as I needed to make many for markers for a project.

{"prompt":"Question: Do you think these paints would adhere to waxed wood? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" I very much doubt it. I think you'd need acrylics for that, but it would be worth googling. In any case, you'd need to prep the surface by at least removing all dirt and oils and maybe giving a final wipe with rubbing alcohol. But that's just me and I'm an experimenter at heart :-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this an alcohol ink? (That was what I searched for.)\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sorry, but I don't know enough about these to answer your question. I know they are colorfast when ironed after drying. I usually add water to them to paint them on fabric that I am going to do needlework on top of. They mix well with water and each other. They will bleed if there is too much volume for the fabric. Nothing comes off once they are dry. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work on a nylon material? (i.e., a drawstring nylon backpack?\n Answer:","completion":" I have used it on silk, cotton, canvas, rayon, polyester, and nylon. (It even works on lycra or spandex but the stretch distorts and cracks the design.) There were no problems with the painting. Be sure to place a paper towel or something behind the fabric to catch the bleed-through. The only issue is when you use the iron to heat set the color. You will need to be careful about the heat for rayon and nylon (or lycra\/spandex). While you want to use the highest setting, you do not want to melt the fabric. I set my iron 2 notches below the highest iron setting. You will want to test a corner to ensure the iron doesn't melt the fabric. But don't skip the step entirely. For hard-to-iron items, I took my hair dryer and, setting it at its highest heat, I held the blower at approximately 1\/2 inch away from surface, close to it, and ran the dryer for about 1 minute over each 3 square inches of painted surface. I wouldn't rely on this to go through a washing machine but it will hold up through careful hand-washing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use other colours besides black and white to paint dark backgrounds?\n Answer:","completion":" YES: you can, get your color chart out and look up backgrounds and they will show you how to make other colors on what your looking for, the paint your showing me now I use on wood,canvas. resin painting it's very cool.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these be mixed together to create custom colors?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these paints have a fine tip point for drawing or writing on fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" No. These are not writer containers. You need to use a brush or other implement to paint with them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the white ink weak on black cotton?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how is it on leather?\n Answer:","completion":" my wife tried it only on fabric\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to make face casts, is this all I would need to make one? I want to add several face casts to a video\/short I'm making.\n Answer:","completion":" For a face cast. I personally use the plaster gauze cut into 1 to 2 inch strips. It is much easier and faster to work with. I use petroleum jelly to keep the gauze from sticking to skin or hair and a perfect cast can be made within a few minutes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used for metal casting does it have to be fired?\n Answer:","completion":" No it doesn't need to be fired and it should be ok for metal as I used (the real stuff) it for thermal forming. This is the same product as USG Hydro Stone. 50lbs of Hydrostone is only $26. plus shipping. Do the math before you buy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used for makin' the mother mold (outer shell) for castin' latex masks?\n Answer:","completion":" It probably can but it is a little porous. Its slightly fragile but will work in a pinch. When you pulled apart the mold it might shatter or break into smaller pieces. If you have a choice I would pick something more durable. this is better used for something like pouring into a cast and set in shapes for children to paint or artistic projects. I used it for a mosaic table top and had issues with corners flaking and it easily chipped. hope this helps!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long does it tack to harden?\n Answer:","completion":" I let it set for thirty minutes before removing the molding material.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you add color to mixture before you mold it?\n Answer:","completion":" absolutely and the best dye to use believe it or not is Wiltons cake decorating Gel. I dont know why but I got some phenomenal colors from using this one night..(It was the only dye I had on hand)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it a heavy material?\n Answer:","completion":" I've noticed it to be a bit heavier then Plaster of Paris of an equal volume, but not by much. It's [weight diffrence between Plaster and this product] only noticeable in large parts (say the size of your hand).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Anyone know where I can download the MSDS and mix instructions for this product?\n Answer:","completion":" There is a general MSDS PDF online. Search \"MSDS for Perfect Cast material\". I could not find it specific to this product. I do not remember if mine came with one. There is also a PDF online for mixing instruction specifically for this product online. Search \"Mixing instruction for Cast & Paint Perfect Cast\". Hope this helps. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to make a mold of two adult hands?\n Answer:","completion":" Nope. Plaster is a hard material, and encasing someone's hands in it is already a bad idea. But its made worse by the fact that plaster hearts up as it sets, this doesn't get very hot. But it could get uncomfortable. Stick with alginate for casting hands, its quicker and non toxic! Seriously you could probably eat it and be fine. It also sets up quicker. The place where this comes In handy (unintentional pun right there) is making the positive of the hands from the negative alginate. I really hope this helps, and saves you hands!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much expansion during cure\/set and has anyone used this with alginate, i want to make a mold using the alginate, use this stuff to make the part\n Answer:","completion":" Honestly I haven't used it as of yet but when I can I'll make a mold with it then I'll get back to you with the details\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What color does it turn out?\n Answer:","completion":" off white\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between this knife (SVR-2) and SVR-1?\n Answer:","completion":" The SVR-2 has a locking feature that prevents the blade from sliding in or out. This is a safety feature that is not present in the svr-1 model.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you also use the 30 degree blades (OLFA 5007 A1160B 9mm Snap-Off Art Blade) in this handle?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't tried the 30 degree blades in this handle but they should fit. You may have trouble snapping off the end of the blade though, it is designed for the angle of the included blade. Amazon does sell a 30 degree Olfa handle - http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/9150US-SAC-1-Stainless-Auto-Lock-Graphics\/dp\/B000BKA6IA\/\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: which blades should i buy to got with it. i can't find any that say 5019 blades. thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" I bought these blades and they work great with this knife handle - http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/9149-ABB-50B-UltraSharp-Snap-Off-50-Pack\/dp\/B0006SJAQ6 These blades will also work- http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/9148US-ABB-10B-Ultra-Snap-off-10-Pack\/dp\/B0006SJAPW http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/5010-AB-10B-Snap-Off-Silver-10-Pack\/dp\/B0006O87LE\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to cut cardboard?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the lock work even when the blade is retracted? I don't want to get poked if I throw this in my pocket.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. The lock is the dark slider at the right end of the knife in the illustration. It is spring loaded, and unlocks only when the slider is pushed forward or backward. As long as no pressure is applied in either direction, the blade is immobilized, and cannot move.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should I get this one or the 30 angle one if I want to sharpen pencils?\n Answer:","completion":" This is not a pencil sharpener. If you 'rd looking for a rough work tool I suggest a simple blade.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a pocket clip on this?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, there is. It's metal and part of the \"snapper\" for the blade segments. I like this snap knife (I just picked it up and admired it.), but it does have one weak point. The snapper, though certainly effective, does not hold the snapped segment at all. It can either go flying or slide into your hand. It's probably best to either use the Ofla blade dispensers with the built-in snappers or just use pliers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with Additional blades?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it comes with only one blade. I ordered extra blades when I ordered the olfa, knowing I would need them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is this knife with the blade retracted?\n Answer:","completion":" Around 6 inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these paints really weigh 6 pounds?\n Answer:","completion":" No way. Maybe that is a typo. It is more like 6 oz.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this leave behind a chalky feeling on the paper when dried?\n Answer:","completion":" No it doesn't it's very smooth\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone tell me how big these are? The diameter of pack and the height when stacked together? Also, how big are the individual color pans?\n Answer:","completion":" 3.25\" in diameter. 1.5\" tall when stacked together. Individual pans are 7\/8\" in diameter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are these watercolor wheel paint stacks transparent paint or opaque watercolors?\n Answer:","completion":" To be on the safe side I will say they are transparent. I have used them both ways, but I often play around with my supplies to see how flexible they are. It also depends what kind of surface you are applying them onto. I have enjoyed these and would buy them again...great quality. I hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these washable - I'm thinking of buying them for my 3 year old?\n Answer:","completion":" They are watercolors and therefore water soluble. But usually for an adult the colors go onto paper.and remove with a water brush scrubber adequate for repaint to a different color or leaving blank white I can't say whether or not they will stain clothing. The paints are nice and bright for the money. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the pinking blade cause thin\/apparel fabric to fray?\n Answer:","completion":" I have only used it with quilting cotton fabrics. I think it will work well on any weight cotton but silky fabrics may be a problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many layers of fabric will it cut through?\n Answer:","completion":" It will cut through 4 at least. Haven't tried any more than that. And I usually just cut thru 2 with this pinking blade, after the seam is sewn.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many blades are in 1 pack?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi. There is just one blade in the pack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this cut through felted material?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I have cut thru felted material for a project and the OLFA cutter works great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this blade cut through cardstock and chipboard?\n Answer:","completion":" It probably would but it would dull the blade down quickly. You would be better off getting a cricket. They are made to use with cardstock and chipboard.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this pinking blade work with the 60mm ergonmetric Deluxe Rotary Cutter by Olfa?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't say for sure as I've never owned a 60mm rotary cutter, but I wouldn't think so. It does fit many other brands of 45mm cutters, but since a 60mm cutter is meant to take a larger blade, the blade most likely won't extend far enough past the plastic to cut. I did look at your exact cutter on the Olfa site and the design doesn't look like it would work with a smaller blade. If you're having trouble finding a 60mm pinking blade, one option would be to pick up the cheapest 45mm rotary cutter that Walmart sells (around $10-13 if I remember correctly, it'll be Fiskars brand) to use with this blade. I can vouch for this blade being compatible with that cutter - I had never used a rotary cutter before; I was curious, but wasn't about to spend a lot of money when I didn't know anything about them so I got the cheapest cutter. Suffice it to say, I fell in love with it immediately and have used it tons! One of my favorite blades is the wave blade - I buy the Olfa brand blades for my Fiskars cutter and they fit perfectly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have the Olfa 45mm rotary cutter RTY-2\/G. Will this blade work on this traditional cutter?\n Answer:","completion":" The RTY-2G looks like a newer version of the one I own. Yes, it should work with no problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the sawtooth on the rotary blade make crisp pointed zigzag edges as the pinking shears do or they appear more as scalloped edges?\n Answer:","completion":" They have a point, but not a really sharp point. They do not appear to me to be scalloped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does it not say in the description that this only fits Olfa handle RTY-2\/DX?\n Answer:","completion":" The handle these blades do NOT fit, came out years after these pinking blades became available. The question should be, why would Olfa produce a new handle that only uses certain blades and not all the blades like the older handles do???\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone found that this will not work in a specific rotary cutter? I called Olfa and was told it works in all 45mm\n Answer:","completion":" It didn't work in my Fiskar. The instructions inside the package said only Olfa cutters can be used. The problem was the way the Fiskar cutter affixes the wavy blade. I hope my experience helps you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would you recomend this product for a 16 week ceramics class?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely. Similar, but cheaper, pottery tool sets have plastic pieces, which I really wouldn't recommend. No plastic tools in this set.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I see that it has a wooden rib, but does it include a metal rib? I am looking for supplies for a ceramics class.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does come with a metal rib.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it come with clay?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it does not come with the clay. I bought this tool set for my 7 yr old granddaughter to go with a beginners potting wheel and I bought the 5 lb bucket of clay separately. She uses some pieces more than others, but really seems to enjoy using all the tools to achieve different effects. They appear to be beginners tools, but how complicated of a tool do you need to shape & score clay? And she is just 7! As long as she enjoys it, I consider it money well spent!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be good for a ten-year old girl to use?\n Answer:","completion":" Sure, if she's taking a pottery class\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the Rib made out of rubber?\n Answer:","completion":" no\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am looking for a tool to clean out the gunk from inside a pumpkin. Would a tool with 'sawteeth' on one edge, mounted on handle do the job? I alrea\n Answer:","completion":" try an iceceam scooper ;D\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this board flexible? They have the thickness as .1 in but does it stay flat?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is flexible but it is also rigid and stays in place. We use this at work and make a couple hundred cuts on ours 5 days a week. This last us years.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this mat to cut wavy lines or circles, and does it still heal? Or does the healing ability depend on cutting straight lines?\n Answer:","completion":" This is the first time I bought something like this. I'm not even sure what \"healing\" means because I can see many, many cuts in the mat. It still works very nicely and I have no idea about wavy lines. I have only used it to make straight lines.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Some \"self-healing\" mats caution against using anything but rotary cutters. Any experience with using X-Acto or razor knives?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought the mat to be used with an X-acto knife as a gift, there have been no complaints\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: non stick bottom, so can you reverse it for when gluing up things and the glue comes right off?\n Answer:","completion":" Not exactly. The reverse is textured. I think they mean more like a non skid bottom. If your used a strong glue I don't think it would come right off. We have a sterilite (sp?) table at work that most glueing happens on. That does clean up easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is the description 18 x 24 but the pic is 11 x 17?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know. I received the size that I ordered. It was for my son and he loves it (especially the lower cost from site he had been buying it).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone use this for making model airplanes using pins to hold pieces in place while drying?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry....no experience with that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it slide or stay in place on table?\n Answer:","completion":" The mat has a bit of natural weight to it and unless you are working on a slippery surface the rubber bottom grabs well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this high enough to comfortably cut for a long period of time, or do you wish you had purchased the adjustable table?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes for me it is perfect, although I am only 5'1\" tall. I cannot stand up for very long, due to my disability, but if I had no disability, it would be prefect for me to stand for a long period of time to cut. I hope that helped. Have a great day!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the height of the table?\n Answer:","completion":" It is 34 3\/4\" tall\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much does it weigh?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't know the weight. Maybe 30 lbs??? I'm not too good at guessing. Easy enough to move around, though, on a hard floor or even carpet. I just looked at the previous answer to your question and I disagree. The table is very sturdy and when put together properly, you'll have no problem with it. I use it for cutting fabric (which its made for) wrapping presents, sorting things when I'm cleaning closets or drawers, etc., etc. This is the second table I've had like this and this one is better made than the first.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you fold it away when it's not in use\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is foldable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the STEM size on the casters. Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" The stem size is 3\/8. they are very sturdy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the actual working dimensions? There are 3 different heighths listed in discriptions\n Answer:","completion":" 3' X 5' table top when totally open for work space Height - 34\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How thick is the table?\n Answer:","completion":" Approximately 1\/2 of an inch thick. This table is not flimsy at all and I frequently take down a leaf and then pull it back up when I need it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the table arrive assembled or require assembly?\n Answer:","completion":" It came pre-assembled, for the most part. My husband says he thought there was SOME assembly. Sad fact is, it's wobbly after a while. This is not a good thing. Initially, I thought it was a great table. I wouldn't buy another one at this point.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where can i purcase parts for the table\n Answer:","completion":" You could try contacting the seller, but it's probably easier going to Home Depot or Lowes. I ended up shoring up the frame with L brackets and that helped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this durable enough to do scrap booking on, how much max weight could it hold ?\n Answer:","completion":" NO. The problem is that the table is shaky. Moving things on it causes it to sway. An older version of the table was ok but the new tables are not the same. I would not recommend this table for any types of crafts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with a pedal? Or at least a place to connect a pedal if u purchase one\n Answer:","completion":" No. This is not a pottery wheel. It's a sculpting wheel. It's best used for hand-built items.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you put a piece of clay on it and mold it into pottery? Or is it not used for that?\n Answer:","completion":" It depends what you mean by molding it. It is basically used as a stand that you can turn so that you can move around your piece as you sculpt it. It is not a motorized pottery wheel.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of metal is this made of?\n Answer:","completion":" Aluminum, I believe.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the actual dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" It is 7\". The height is about the same, 7\". It is good to use as a turn table while working on a project.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What powers this product? What's the power source?\n Answer:","completion":" It is not powered. you spin it by hand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you have to spin it by hand\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, this is not a pottery wheel. It is for hand built things. It enables you to turn your piece without having to actually pick it up and turn it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How heavy duty are these? For example, would they easily cut through multiple layers of felt?\n Answer:","completion":" I have used them for cutting three layers of denim. They would certainly cut through two layers of felt. I do not think they would easily cut through more.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just received these today and cannot get them to open up. How do they open? I apologize...I know this is a dumb question!\n Answer:","completion":" They are very stiff when you first get them. Just keep wiggling them open and then when they do open, just open and close them a few times to loosen them up. If they are really too stiff to open, then wedge something between the handles and twist a little bit to get it started. If still no luck, then find a coin, or a large flat head screwdriver and loosen the flat screw in the center a few millimeters.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would these be good for cutting scotch tape? I only need them to make chevron designs for my nails. Other scissors don't work well with tape.\n Answer:","completion":" These don't work well with paper or thin products. They are great for fabric and anything thicker than card stock paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these comparable or better than Gingher Pinking Shears?\n Answer:","completion":" I cannot say that these are better or worse than Gingher pinking shears. I like them because they open and close easily and are sharp and do the job. I have small hands and these work well for me. The price was also right for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these good for cutting scotch tape?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know why you'd want to use these to cut scotch tape, but I would not use my own on an adhesive. I would imagine the residue builds up quickly and affects the action, and I don't ever want to have to scrub sharp, jagged edges.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would they be comfortable for left handed people\n Answer:","completion":" Being right handed myself, I can not really say for sure, however, they are remarkably light weight for pinking sheers. (And they actually work well.) I would guess if you are used to other right handed scissors, you'll be fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these good for cutting tissue paper to create a scalloped edge\n Answer:","completion":" i guess....but this has the zig zag on it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the TK 9071 6B 3.15 Mm fit the TK 9400 clutch pencil\n Answer:","completion":" It does not fit this specific TK9400 with ASIN number B0007OECDA. This specific TK9400 with ASIN number B0007OECDA is 2mm. You may search for Faber Castell TK 9400 Clutch Pencil 3.15mm 4B with ASIN number B000WGVH2M. This is 3.15mm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the casing metal or plastic?\n Answer:","completion":" Metal ! And it is a really hood buy. I use it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the lead advance per click or does it drop?\n Answer:","completion":" Drops\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with lead or is this just the pencil?\n Answer:","completion":" It has one HB lead.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these all green, or are there various colors? (I have a green one and want another just like it of a different color)\n Answer:","completion":" It comes in green only\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have a built in sharpener like the others?\n Answer:","completion":" The Faber-Castell TK 9400 Clutch does not have an on-board sharpener. I say buy it anyway. The weight and balance are excellent, there's no dorky pocket clip, and for general sharpening (including a 2 mm lead) you want a free-standing KUM Automatic Long Point sharpener anyway.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have a built in sharpener like the others?\n Answer:","completion":" This one doesn't. The end doesn't come off at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: dose it have a clip?\n Answer:","completion":" There was no clip, nor any sign of an attachment\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why are your ink pads dry?\n Answer:","completion":" The case doesn't create a seal and therefore the pads dry out very quickly. Also the composition of the inks might have something to do with it. Poor Product\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How big is each color square?\n Answer:","completion":" 2\" X 2\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to fix dried inkpads?\n Answer:","completion":" With the older ink formulas, a bit of alcohol rubbed on the pad and letting it sit awhile helped some. With the newer, washable inks - not sure. Myself, if a bit of alcohol or water didn't liven the ink up some, I would look into buying a bottle of the roll-on inkers if they still manufacture them. They look like one of those roll-on deodorant bottles but have ink pad ink in them. If none of the above are helpful, toss it and buy another one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the stamp pad separable?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Mine didn't work very well. It hardly showed up on the paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What's the difference in using this and the side cutter foot\n Answer:","completion":" The overlock vertical, overcast (conceals the edges) and sew the seam at the same time. The side cutter does the same, but it also cut the excess fabric as it sews. Checkout the reviews on the Overlock Vertical and the Side Cutter Foot. Happy sewing!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know if this works with the XL 2121 model?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see that model under \"Product Descriptions\". I has an XL 2230, etc. However, I have purchased products that did not have my model number listed and they still worked. You can give it a try and if it doesn't work, then return it. Here's the model listed: Product Description Use overcast stitches and see difference foot makes in appearance.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this foot fit the SE 425?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sorry I have no idea whether that will fit or not. My suggestion would be to find out if your machine is high shank or low shank, then determine if the foot is high or low shank. Match low to low and high to high and you should be fine. That seems to be the deciding factor. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this foot fit a PS3700?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if the PS3700 is a Brother's machine if so Brother's list those machines it fits and if it is not a Brothers you can certainly contact them a they will surly tell you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it compatible with Singer 2277?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know about the compatibility, but I didn't find it a good deal altogether.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do I tell if my machine is 5mm or 7mm? I have a brother cs6000i.\n Answer:","completion":" You can use either with your machine, it is the width of the overlock stitch, roughly 3\/16\" for the 5mm and almost 3\/8\" for the 7mm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know if this works w\/CS6000i?\n Answer:","completion":" I have this presser foot and the CS-6000i. They work perfectly together.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this compatible with a singer?\n Answer:","completion":" This is compatible with a Brother and I am pretty sure it is with a Singer also, but can not give a definite on it, but for the price it is sure worth it to get it. It is great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it work with the Brother HC1850\n Answer:","completion":" If your machine uses snap on feet it will in all likelihood fit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you have the ruffler for bernina 560?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not have a ruffle. I use my bernina for quilting and the 20n I use for zig zag stitches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it fit bernina virtuosa 150?\n Answer:","completion":" It fits.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you do any zigzag stitch with this foot?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm pretty sure a zigzag stitch with this foot would result in frustration and broken needles very quickly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Bought the SA185 1\/4 foot but when I install it the needle will not line up with the hole. Can't use. I have a Brother machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Try putting your needle position on zero one. That should solve the problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it work w\/my Brother Innovis VQ2400? Dream Creator sewing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm so sorry I can't help with this question. I bought this machine to try and teach myself how to sew. so I really don't know anything about sewing or different machines at all. I know I'm in the minority so you should get some answers from qualified people. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could you list what machine models these part are for. It woul make it so much easier for the customers.\n Answer:","completion":" I am able to use this 1\/4 in. foot on my basic Janome Sewing machine, Babylock Ellageo, Babylock Ellure Plus and Brother 4000D. The foot doesn't come with a shaft attached so it just clips on the one that is already on these machines. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this foot sew over pins?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, I read that it is not a good idea and I haven't tried it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Write up says Genuine Brother made accessory, customer review of 8\/4\/11 says it is not. Can recent buyer confirm?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it depends on the seller you choosee. I bought from Amazon and mine was a Brother part in the appropriate packaging.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I'm having trouble with the hidden zipper foot. The needle is to far from the zipper. Can I move the needle 1mm?\n Answer:","completion":" If you have a computerized machine, the needle settings are on the screen. You can go into your needle settings and move the need by .5mm to the left or right until it is in the right position. If you do not have a computerized machine, you would have to refer to your machine's manual under \"needle position.\" In most newer machines, the needle position can be moved in order to accommodate seam allowance changes.

{"prompt":"Question: Can you only use this with a invisible zipper? what about nylon zippers? I don't like the zipper foot I have. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Small or standard nylon zipper should work, This foot has grooves in the bottom so the needle gets very close to the zipper teeth. If you have a coat zipper with large teeth, it won't fit in the grooves.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Thick Fabrics; vs. BC1000? Can anyone attest to the power of this machine, for sewing through, say, mutiple layers of denim or other thick layers?\n Answer:","completion":" I have been working with this machine for about a week, and really like it for what it can do. However, it does have a bit of a difficulty getting over thick portions of the fabric.....where two seams intersect, etc. For this reason, I would assume that it might have a difficult time with thicker fabrics. I've learned that when I must sew over the intersection of seams, I must go very slowly. Then, it's pretty good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Torn between the ES2000, CS6000i, and the BC1000: Any guidance?\n Answer:","completion":" I've researched this unit for my wife & found these Brother machines a similar series: Sixty-stitch BC 1000\/CP 6500\/CS 6000I\/CS 6000T\/EX 660 Seventy-stitch HS 2500\/CP 7500\/XR 7700 Seventy-seven-stitch ES 2000 Eighty-stitch XR 9000 It seems cosmetics, number of stitches, and low price variations are the only differences\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: price difference: WHY.\n Answer:","completion":" Because Amazon allows several different vendors to sell products through their marketplace. The search result reflects the lowest price among those vendors, and that won't always be Amazon. If that's the case, you'll see that low price over on the right hand side of the page. I am usually inclined to spend a few bucks more and get something from Amazon though.\n"}

I am thoroughly enjoying this machine. It is one of the best I've ever owned.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will This work in India?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know what kind of power you have in India. This machine is 110, not 220 as far as I know. You should get in touch with the manufacturer and ask your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What accessories come with this machine (i.e., buttonhole foot, zipper foot, button fitting foot, etc)?\n Answer:","completion":" I gave the machine as a gift to my 11 year old great niece so I can not look for accessories.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this require a specific grade lamp\/bulb to solidify?\n Answer:","completion":" [Not sure what you mean by \"solidify\". Wipe the emulsion into the screen, then let it dry completely in a dark place, then expose it.] I use a generic 500w worklight, like from Lowes or Home Depot, 18 to 24 inches above the screen, about 9 minutes. No safety grill, which would cause shadows. You MUST experiment first... create a design with some pattern, then expose it in sections ... use a piece of cardboard to incrementally uncover more of the pattern so that one end gets X minutes, the next X+1 minutes, etc., then do the wash-out and see which worked best.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you overexpose a screen? What happens if you overexpose one?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I once exposed a screen longer than the recommended time and it was extremely difficult to remove the part that should wash out. Instead of coming out with a forceful spray of water I had to scrub. I believe it's important to stick to the exact time listed for the light source you are using.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this come with the printing screen?\n Answer:","completion":" No, this is just emulsion, activator. And remover.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many screens will this kit cover?\n Answer:","completion":" I double coat both sides with a scoop coated. I get about 7 or 8 from a bottle. You don't need to coat both sides so you should get a dozen or so. You will also use a lot more if you try to squeegee coat em instead of using a scoop coater\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this fit my Brother Dream Creator VM5100\n Answer:","completion":" This foot is a \"Low Shank\" presser foot. To determine which presser foot you need for your machine - (High Shank or Low Shank): To Measure: When presser foot is down, measure the distance from the bottom of the pressure foot to the screw-hole that holds the foot onto the presser bar. *A high shank machine measures approximately 1 1\/4\" from the presser foot screw to the bottom of the foot. (Uses High Shank Sewing Feet) *A low shank machine measures approximately 3\/4\" from the presser foot screw to the bottom of the foot. (Uses Low Shank Sewing Feet) Sometimes you can find adapters, but I would try to find \"low\" or \"high\" shank as your machine needs. I hope this helps you!!\n"}

You will need to unscrew the snap on and then screw this one on and it will work like a dream. To gather you will need to place the fabric under the pressure foot and just sew. To gather AND see you will need to place one material under the foot and the piece you are attaching it to between the slot and sew. It will gather as you see. I love mine. The ruffler is cool to have too!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this fit a Singer 7470?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, this will fit your Singer 7470.

{"prompt":"Question: would this fit a brother se400?\n Answer:","completion":" I wondered the same thing about my Brother Sewing Machine, I went on google to find out what sew machines would best fit the Gathering Foot and, there was the answer. It gave so much information about the subject.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a Singer brand product?\n Answer:","completion":" Im going to say its probably not. Or at least its not packaged \"singer\" But its EXACTLY like the singer trust me. And so much cheaper. Mine doesnt even have that plastic part in the center there. Mine is all metal. Works great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Brother LS2125i. Would this foot work on my machine, since it has snap-on feet?\n Answer:","completion":" Depends whether you have a low or high shank machine. Should be able to find that info in your user manual. (As stated, this will fit most low shank machines) You simply remove the snap on foot piece and screw this foot on in it's place. One word of warning tho... it's a great foot for fmq, I really loved it. However, I no longer use it as it wore a groove in my needle bar. I don't know if it was just a bad fit with my machine or the foot itself, but something to keep an eye on if you do buy it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a vintage Singer 15 treadle.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this darning foot fit Singer Inspiration 4212 model?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure, but the foot will fit many low shank machines. I'd check your Singer manual to see what feet they list for your specific machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with the older Singer Darning machines? Such as the 47W70 model?\n Answer:","completion":" No that particular singer doesn't use snap on feet and I do not believe if you had a shank adaptor it would work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this work with the SINGER One Easy-to-Use Computerized Sewing Machine?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure but it goes on in a pretty typical way, so if your machine has a pretty typical needle \"set up\" I think it will be fine. It interchanges easily on my machine (not an embroidery machine).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to glue metal to metal will this glue work?\n Answer:","completion":" I've used Beacon Glass on my Motorhome to mount new glass to the steel framing on three windows. This was done over 5 years ago and the windows still open and close using the handle mounted to the steel framing. What caused me to use Beacon Glass to make the repair was a situation where the glass was separating from the steel framing when opening or closing the window. So in answer to your question I confident it will adhere steel to steel very well and maintain adherence is hot and cold temperatures also.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a metal frame coffee table. I want to stick glass on the metal base becasue it may slide and break. Will this stick glass to metal?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes provided you use enough. There is a double stick side Styrofoam tape that might be a better idea. I don't know how heavy your glass is, if it's too heavy it might squeeze the glue out. I don't know how wide of a space you have to glue. I personally would get some type of fabric and put glue on both sides of the fabric, glue the fabric to the table and then the glass to the fabric. That's how I would do it. But once it dries for 48 hours, it will stick.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am having trouble bonding a wood block to the back of a china dinner plate-this is a craft project and will be outside- will this work\n Answer:","completion":" I've only used it glass to glass, outside full sun in Texas. It has worked great, been almost a year.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: can beacons glass,metal &amp; more glue be used to seal a pitcock on a radiator so it dont leak?\n Answer:","completion":" I have to be totally honest, I have never tried that. But I know it can glue a Very fine gemstone to a flat piece of sterling silver and you don't have to worry about it falling off. Even without prongs. I trust the glue. So my guess for the answer to your question is... yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: all of the bad reviews say stuff about the pens leaking, even though there are like 30x better reviews, I'm now worried if I order them they wont work\n Answer:","completion":" I've purchased both the colored pens and the black pens and have had only one pen leak on me. I have followed other reviewer's instructions on \"being gentle\" and not pressing too hard or shaking them and the pens have lasted me for almost 6 months using them pretty regularly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i paint over my pigma micron black illustration, to fill in some areas.

I hope this helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these pens write on plastic? I want to mark pips on minature dice.\n Answer:","completion":" I have tried writing on several different types of plastics and so far they write on all types, but they do not stay on all types. They will of course wipe off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is clam ink?\n Answer:","completion":" Honestly, I think clam ink just means the pens come in a clamshell plastic case. It is what they are shipped in and it opens like a clam...they also have a set of 3 pens that come in a plastic \"bubble\" type packaging. One that is glued down to the cardboard, you know? But, look at the pens specifically for Zentangle and it says clamshell packaging, not clam ink pens. But, in my true and honest opinion, these are the best pens for drawing, doodling, sketching, whatever...even just writing. They do not bleed through the paper, to the other side or another piece, they do not fade, they do not move off the paper and smear once dry...these are just the best pens. Also, I believe they are archival quality, which means they are acid free, so you could use them in scrapbooking and other things. TRY them! You will not be disappointed...and this is the best price I have found for 6 different sized black ink pens of this quality...Fantastic! I hope this answered your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will they smear if I use copics with them?\n Answer:","completion":" i have in fact seen that they sometimes will smear. the best way to stop smearing is putting a piece of paper under you hand while drawing and letting only the pen touch the drawing\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should I get these or the staedtlers felt ones? Quality wise only, for sketching!\n Answer:","completion":" I prefer these Sakura Pigma pens for sketching. They hold their tip and last a long time. I would stay away from felt just because they seem to lose their point sooner. YOu might also look at Faber-Castell. While I don't like these quite as well, I know an instructor who recommends them. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these pens have an odor and are they non toxic\n Answer:","completion":" They do not have an odor, and according to the official website for the pens, (www.sakuraofamerica.com\/Pen-Archival), it is not toxic.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it work for fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not big on this brand of pens, but they do seem to work on some fabrics. For me..I rather spend a few dollars more for a better grade of pen ( Staedtler is my favorite). The tips on Micron pens don't hold up very well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do these hold up when scanning? I want to scan and edit illustrations in Photoshop without the lines have that \"blurry\" look\n Answer:","completion":" They hold up great! Before scanning, make sure any erasing you may have done hasn't lightened the lines. Make sure to scan at least 300 DPI. I'm on my 106th page using these, I love them\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can they write on painted wood?\n Answer:","completion":" yep! I actually just used these a couple days ago to draw a company logo on a painted wooden lighthouse. they worked amazingly, didn't smear at all.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is that only box or it is included all tools and spools that i see it in the picture??\n Answer:","completion":" Only the box. Does include the spool holder but no thread our other sewing accessories.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Am i right in thinking that this box does NOT come with all the threads and stuff shown here?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there room for a pin cushion?\n Answer:","completion":" The box has several compartments that can easily accommodate a pin cushion.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it hold about 20 regular size spools of thread and does it then a place for bobbins?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sorry, but I use this for storing all sizes of household batteries, not for sewing items. To me it looks like the back half would hold more than 20 spools of thread and then you still have the front half which would hold way more than just bobbins, if we are talking about the same size bin that I bought.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there pegs for storing the spools on?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry for late response, wasn't at the house where the box was located. There is a removable tray that has pegs for storing thread. If you look at the picture of it, you can see an (approx.) three high by dozen wide group of thread, that is the tray. There is a place in the box for the tray and if desired you can remove it for ease of access.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do these cut paper into strips? Or can I cut the edges of a circle to make it scallop edged circles?\n Answer:","completion":" The Fiskars scissors can be used in various applications. You can use them to cut paper into decorative strips, circles or other shapes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: these Fiskars are only for right handers??\n Answer:","completion":" It would seem to me that they are for a right handed person. I would put that question for a definite answer, to the Fiskars company.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these scissors cut cardstock?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, they can cut cardstock.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can they cut felt?\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, but these edgers are only for paper. I've tried using these to cut cotton fabric. It mangles the fabric, which is much thinner than felt. And the same definitely goes for scissors only made to cut fabric: they will become dull if you use them to cut paper. There are some Fiskar's brand rotary cutters made to cut fabric with a zig-zaggy edge, which are awesome when cutting felt or fabric. So far, I've not found any of the \"wheels\"\/blades that have the same edging shapes as the paper edgers, except a pinking blade.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are these markers good for 1\/144 scale gundams?\n Answer:","completion":" They are like small paint brushes, not really like markers at all. the squeeze out paints. the grey one is more of a marker but also not a super fine point. so... no. not unless you want to use them to mix small amounts of paint on a tray for the back of a clear part or for fingers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How good is the coverage of the Paint? Since I am trying to paint the uncolored (black) pieces from the Valvrave I Full Impact model kit.\n Answer:","completion":" It's very good, I've repainted Red frame with a set and they're still going. But be sure to shake them well and most likely you'll need to do more then one coat, let the coats dry 100% be for re-coating. Other wise you'll damage the first coat and waste paint. The metallic paint need more shaking then the others as well, but once it's started it covers just as well as the others.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these dry or is top coat required?\n Answer:","completion":" they dry, top coat is not required\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the fine tip marker point good for panels in 1\/144 models such as RX-78-2 RG and Gundam Age Legilis HG?\n Answer:","completion":" it will do an \"OK\" job for panel lining, but you would really want to have a panel lining lining marker to do so, like GM01 or GM02 marker. I use the fine tip that came with this for some of the finer engraved parts, like the interior of the shield on the RX-78-2\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this works on Zoids HMM models\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can't read what the markers say. Are they toxic or non toxic? Is it water based?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't read what the box says either. However with my experience working with them I can say they are similar to other paint pens out there. I would say they are water base, the paint dries fairly quickly and does wash off with water. As for if they are non toxic or not I can't say (since I can't read what it says) but to be safe I would avoid eating them. Hope this is some help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these work for weathering?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there a black marker? i see a grey. red. yellow, blue and something else that i think is a black.\n Answer:","completion":" No black marker included on this pack.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do you recommend as a temporary car sticker?.. Can it be easily removed?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it is not easily removed. If ya don't mind scraping it is alright to use otherwise steer clear of it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the ink come off easily when wet?\n Answer:","completion":" I did not have any problem with that but it would depend possibly in your printer ink as well. My HP ink dried fast.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How removable is this product? I want to put on a laminated board and remove it after a couple of weeks.\n Answer:","completion":" I do not think it will come off easily without damaging the board. I use this on glass blocks and it sticks pretty good.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this safe for walls?\n Answer:","completion":" It has a texture similar to contact paper so I would guess so but I haven't tried it. Try on a small unnoticable spot?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this wheel any different from this one? http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Speedball-Artis...\n Answer:","completion":" It sure appears the same! By the way, we all really love this wheel. You can stand, sit, and it cleans easily. I have had people from 9 - 72 years old all use this successfully too.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am trying to order some extra bats. I want to make sure I get the right size so the pins fit. Are these universal? 11\", 12\", 14\"?\n Answer:","completion":" The pins on the artista wheel are 3\/8 inch pins on a 10 inch center, which is standard. Standard bats have the pin holes at this spacing no matter how big or small the diameter of the bat. The problem you run into is the size of the splash pan (the brown plastic, 2 piece, removal pan around the wheel head). A 7.5 or 9 inch square bat fits nicely, but I find it makes me dizzy watching the corners go around. Other people say it doesn't bother them. A 12 inch round bat fits perfectly. BUT, a 14 inch bat may hit the splash pan. I never tried one, but measured just now and it is close enough to be questionable. You can take the splash pan off and then you could use it - but then all the wet glop would fly off onto you and the surrounding area. Any larger than 14 inches would not fit at all because the motor mount that sticks up would be in the way. I recommend the 12 inch bats. Don't get the 10 inch Shrimpo Aspire bats - they WILL NOT fit. Don't panic if the new bats fit very tight. I had to gently sand a couple bat holes to get them to fit. But tight is good. Loose bats make it very hard to throw. You don't want any wiggle.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, is it shipped in a box? If so, what are the dimensions of the box?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi! The potter's wheel is shipped in a heavy box. It was very well packed with Styrofoam. All I had to do was pull it out of the box! I can guess that the box was about 36 x 36 x 12. A close estimate. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with legs or do you have to purchase them separately?\n Answer:","completion":" It does not come with legs. You can purchase them separately. I have never needed them as I put it on a table (it has enough weight and little rubber feet so it doesn't slide around) or I put it on a truck box which has a flat top and I straddle the box and sit on a pillow and throw that way. A friend turns a 5 gallon bucket over and puts the wheel on that and sits on a stool and throws.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it possible to use a pedal with this unit ?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. The pedal is purchased separately There are also legs that you can get for it. .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Thinking of purchasing this as a gift. I'm a pottery ignoramus. So: is the gift worthless if I don't also get the recipient a kiln?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm a beginner using air dry clay to practice. The wheel works really well. Eventually we all need a kiln but the air dry clay is good initially if you don't have one. Something to aspire to!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you ship in France ?? please please I really need one\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, this item cannot be exported.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the wattage?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't tell you. I looked on the wheel, but that information was not listed. It has a 3 prong plug and plugs into a standard outlet. Here is some information from another site. 1\/3 horsepower (large motor enclosure at back of wheel) 120 Volt, regular household electricity. Motor Size Compares with Thomas Stuart Prodigy, Classic, and Legend wheels at a fraction of the cost, and is larger than the Brent IE 1\/4 HP. Hope that helps you a little. Not sure what you are trying to figure out. It is a light duty machine. If you are planning on working with a lot of clay for a long time every day - get a bigger more powerful wheel. if you want a wheel you can pick up and take with you for demos - its great. If you throw a bit and need to save space - it works great. My husband figured a 1\/3 horsepower motor should be about 248.5 watts - this is dividing a 1 horse power motor's wattage (745.7 watts) into thirds. It is not listed anywhere on the documentation.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions of the product and the box?\n Answer:","completion":" It has been a long time since I had the box. I originally was going to keep the box to store\/carry it, but realized that was not going to work. The box was large and awkward, while the wheel itself was easy to carry around. The dimensions of the wheel are 25 in x 17 in wide x 9 in high. I kept the box just long enough to make sure everything worked and I didn't have to send it back.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What types of clay does it work with?\n Answer:","completion":" Ceramic clay is all we have used on it. It works great\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i use this when diy body lotion? what is the difference between this procude and urea &amp; allantoin?\n Answer:","completion":" This should be safe for cosmetic products, but I would definitely suggest contacting jacquard to see about its purity (usp grade is 99.9% pure). As to the difference, urea and allantoin are two different compounds. Urea on it's own is a generic humectant with some emollient properties. It has been used in lotions and balms up to 40% for skin redness and irritation. Allantonin has the same functions as urea, but is more emollient in nature (think lanolin) and is the more common ingredient used in cosmetics due to these properties. To make matters more confusing both allantonin and urea are BOTH referred to urea because of annoying naming conventions. So to sum up, you should be able to use this just fine though I'd contact the company. Urea is a little more therapeutic in use and a generic humectant, while allantonin will give you that softer creamy glide along with softening and humectant properties. Side note: urea is ubiquitous in labs for so many things, but I wanted to focus on your question regarding use in lotions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you use the urea for tie dying tshirts? and how much do you use?\n Answer:","completion":" We used it as a dye additive for the purpose of keeping the colors bright (which, I believe, the urea does by slowing the dye's ability to dry.) We've only dyed just the one batch of shirts I can say that the colors haven't faded after several washings. In fact I would venture to say the color has held as well--if not better--than commercially dyed shirts. However I cannot directly attribute this to the use of the urea since, like I mentioned, I haven't dyed without it. The amount to use should be on the instructions, but it wasn't much (we measured in teaspoons or tablespoons, if I remember correctly.)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be added (in tiny amounts) to drinking water for rinsing my mouth due do GERD to protect my teeth?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought mine to make some urea skin cream. Not sure what GERD is, but a wee bit of urea isn't all that much to worry about. I have never heard of it as a mouth rinse.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used for tye dying?\n Answer:","completion":" That is what I used it for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this Potassium Aluminum Sulfate or Aluminum sulfate?\n Answer:","completion":" It is Potassium Aluminum Sulfate. You can find other chemical info on Jacquards website: http:\/\/jacquardproducts.com\/assets\/jacquard-site\/support\/msds\/chemicals\/Alum.pdf\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this product added to watercolors\/acrylics to help get the marbled look?\n Answer:","completion":" you use this mixed with water to coat the paper or fabric so that it will absorb the colors you have marbled.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this pure 100% alum? Could this be used for hygiene as well?\n Answer:","completion":" I would not use it as it is not been rated for pharmacuetic or cosmetic purposes. I use it for marbling paper\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this the alum needed for scented stones?home made scented air freshener's.\n Answer:","completion":" I'm fairly (not 100%) sure you can't. I had no luck doing crystals, which surprised me. It worked out for me anyway. I was able to make a super saturated solution that I could use in place of the Alum that is sold as 'Barber Alum'. You could probably use a small container to hold a solution and add the scent, but I doubt that's what you are looking for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this enough to make egg geodes with 6 kids? Or do I need to buy more than 1 lb worth of alum powder?\n Answer:","completion":" You can make about two batches with that amount. We did a project with three kids and each one had about 3-4 egg shells\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions and what does it come with? Does it come with the sponge and paper?\n Answer:","completion":" The box is roughly 10\" x 15\". I comes with one full size sponge and 5 sheets of paper. It worked great for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have this product, and find it difficult or impossible to get the top to lock onto the base. How do I make it fit?\n Answer:","completion":" carefully...not carefully fitting the lid to the palette caused cracks at the corners. lack of patience and carelessness caused my smaller palette to look a little battered, but it still keeps paint fresh for a few weeks...there is a narrow groove around the lid of this item. carefully line the groove of the lid w the white tray. press in place, working from one corner around to the next. if the lid is crooked or buckled, remove it and try again.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I meant for my question to ask if anyone used this item for water mixable OIL paint and once posted couldn't clarify so thanks to answering that too?\n Answer:","completion":" sorry, i don't have a clue. never heard of water mixable oil paint. i can tell you that this tray is so air tight that paints stay wet for days. there's a sponge sheet inside and waxy paper. most importantly, if properly placed, the lid and pan are pretty air tight. i was careless and cracked my first one, but it still keeps my acrylics moist for days. i'm guessing if you can use water w your paint, this'll work. you can also email the maker of this product for a more definitive answer. glad i tried it. hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: On reviewer mentioned using this item with oil paint so do you all think it would also work for water mixable paint? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" yes, I paint in acrylics and it works very well. I also found putting glass in the bottom helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it work with watercolors?\n Answer:","completion":" This palette has no wells for watercolor however it is large enough to place an open wc palette inside it. A better watercolor choice would be a john pike wc palette which is large. Other options for a tight seal in wc palettes are available Some have extra mixing tops and inserts making a lot of mixing room.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size is this\n Answer:","completion":" Measuring the top of the lid it is 16 3\/4\" long,12 3\/4\" wide and 1 3\/4\" deep. So the base is just a little smaller than that. Hope this is helpful to you Kristy.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do the dancers really not have faces painted on them???\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I set my Singer 7442 sewing machine to make basting stitches?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, push the stitch length all the way to the left until you hear a beeping, then immediately move it all the way to the right. I usually adjust the tension on top a little looser also so the basting thread is looser which makes it easier to gather fabric. Remember, every time you turn your machine off, it defaults to the tiny stitch, so you must repeat this step whenever you want to baste.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: My sister told me that glue guns don't glue permanently. I'm building a dollhouse, and I want permanent glue. Does it depend on the glue stick used?\n Answer:","completion":" It really depends on what type of glue sticks you are using. All glue sticks are not created equally, there is a huge variety that ranges from crafting all the way to industrial, all in the form of a glue stick. The average glue sticks you find in the craft or dollar stores are typical for the average craft project, however, if you are using them for anything else that requires strength and permanence, your best bet is to order online from a specialty house. Especially with a dollhouse. The better quality glue you use the less likely you are to make a mess with them, since they burn quicker, easier to control and are more free-glowing, you don't have to use as much. The higher quality ones also don't leave behind all those awful \"wax strings\" all crafters hate. Do a general web search for \"Permanent Seal Glue Sticks\", that will begin your search. Here's a website to help get you started that sells a variety of sticks; http:\/\/www.gluefast.com\/products\/hot-melt-glue-sticks.html and www.dickblick.com also has a variety. Note: I'm not an employee of either of the above mention businesses, I simply use their products an can tell you from experience. Hope this helps, good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought mini (.27\") glue sticks by accident. I tried using them anyway, but couldn't get any glue to come out. I put two sticks in. Have I ruined it?\n Answer:","completion":" hi i have to agree with vid pro. i do not believe you have ruined it at all. i would get the gun hot again and push more sticks of glue through too. even if you used mini sticks keep pushing thru even if you used a wooden skewer to help push it thru [ never use metal,] only a wood skewer, just to push it as soon as you see the glue come through, try to get all the glue mini sticks out that way.might as well get the right sized glue sticks cos this will be a repeat of the same ole problem you are having now if you don't. the best thing is just use the right size sticks to push out the mini sticks of glue out, then you can bypass wood skewer. that is what i would do. you should really use the mini glue sticks for a smaller gun cos the chamber is made for the mini sticks that is why it is difficult to get the glue flow out with this gun. rest assured i use this glue gun profesionally i own 2 i love this gun. this gun is HOT please make sure to have ice water near you can dunk a finger in, helps to cool the glue so the burn isn't so bad. live and learn please be careful. enjoy that gun hope this helps pammypurple\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: my question is there a way to tell what glue sticks are real good and that stick very well. like a point number thing. especially for wood.\n Answer:","completion":" Hot glue guns are very good for certain things. If you want a heavy duty, permanent bond like for furniture I would say go with a better bonding agent like a high quality wood glue or gorilla glue. For lighter projects hot glue is great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a plug on nozzle that needs to be removed for first time use? I inserted glue stick and heated for over 5 minutes and no glue comes out. ??\n Answer:","completion":" No, there is no plug installed. This is just a problem with this product - it may work and it may not. Just do not squeeze the trigger too hard or you may have hot glue coming out the back of the gun instead of the nozzle. Please read my review on this product for more information.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this glue gun have a high &amp; low switch?\n Answer:","completion":" Not that I have seen or used. It works really well and is light weight so your hands don't get fatigue with long use.\n"}

If you are going to make very long button holes you will want the XL-2610 as the automatic ones made by the XL-2600i are limited in length to 1 1\/8 inch.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How well does this work with yarn? I'd like to get a sewing machine that allows me to line my crochet projects!\n Answer:","completion":" This machine is only set up for thread.

{"prompt":"Question: does it have perforated pages?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it is the best paper ever. You will not be disappointed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the paper thick enough for sharpies without bleeding?\n Answer:","completion":" If you are not too heavy with the sharpie, yes. I use Pigma Micron pens (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0008G8G8Y\/) without any problem. But it's more for sketching than finished art work. I use it as a traditional sketchbook to capture the mood and my thoughts in addition to a photo. Photos tend to miss the mood of the moment that a sketchbook can capture. If you are heavy with a sharpie, then you would just no use the reverse side of the page. Or you could use something like a Strathmore Visual Journal (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B003YIZ0DW).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why does the cost per unit increases as you try to do a bulk order? i.e. 1 unit cost $4.85, 2 units cost almost $15.00\n Answer:","completion":" The cost changes because you are buying from different sellers.

{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone found an attractive leather or fabric cover that fits this sketchbook?\n Answer:","completion":" No, I've not. You could, however find cloth you like and decoupage it on to the front, back and inside covers. The wire binding would still show, of course.\n"}
