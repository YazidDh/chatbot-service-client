{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with the Singer simple 3116?\n Answer:","completion":" I really don't know. If your machine has a low or short shank it should. I know it works on the Futura machine and I think it is better than the one that came with my machine because it gets closer to the zipper or anything you want to get close to. When I googled your machine a site came up that sells parts and the shank used to attach the snap on presser feet looks exactly like mine and one is described as a low shank, so my guess is it would fit.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: would these be good for cutting wired ribbon?\n Answer:","completion":" They are a very good pair of sissors, how long they would last would probably be a risk if used a lot for wired ribbon. If you are talking about wired ribbon used for decorating a few packages, probably alright, but for use in a flower shop with thicker wire I don't think they would last. They are a very good pair of sissors that were bought by us for the handle style. Can they be used by someone with big hands as easily as someone with small hands.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I was wanting to get these for my grandma, she does a lot of intricate scrap booking work and was wondering if she could use these for small projects?\n Answer:","completion":" I think these scissors are great for cutting fabric, the blades are really sharp and it creates a straight line with ease. However, for cutting small things such as tiny curves and whatnot, I'm not sure you'd have the control as much with these as opposed to other scissors. Since there isn't a loop to grasp, I'm not sure how they would handle scrapbooking jobs. I suppose it would take some getting used to. If it were me, I think I'd prefer different scissors for that. But I LOVE these for sewing projects! I hope this isn't discouraging, and perhaps other people will disagree with me. Just my thoughts! On another note, they way be better for arthritic hands if she suffers from that! It might be worth a try.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I need scissors to cut through matted horse hair. can you recemond one that will work?\n Answer:","completion":" These should work, D. I cut up my indoor compost, sometimes pretty stemmy stuff, and trim heather and the like outside. The blades are fairly pointy so if you have some super thick mats, you could cut in layers. The grip and the spring allow for extra leverage I think.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone use these on cutting leather belts for cuff bracelets for example, not extremely thick?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't tried cutting leather, you don't say how thick it is, but I have cut heavy webbing with ease so I think they should work OK.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: vinyl\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I believe it would cut through vinyl Sir. I have used mine to cut both ridged and soft natural leathers, fabrics from shear to heavy. It moved through fluidly without any difficulty. Unfortunately Sir it does have limits. You have to be aware as to how many layers you want to put the blade through. I would try on some scrap layered vinyl to find the best amount to cut through without difficulty. Truthfully, I would be lost without my rotary cutter.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it work well for cutting pages out of magazines? I.e. I'd like to cleanly trim whole pages from magazines as close to the binding as possible.\n Answer:","completion":" I imagine it would. I do think that it would cut through more than one page though. You would have to hold the magazine very flat to clear the thickness of the guards on the blade. Also there would be a \"bump\" as it got on and off the magazine. A single edge s razor or Xacto knife might be good also.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it cut carpet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it can cut carpet, but the blades won't last very long. And, you'd probably be better using the 65mm style and blades. Still, there are probably better options for carpet.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does the Fiskars 9528 replacement blades fit a Fiskars 9521 cutter?\n Answer:","completion":" They are both listed as 45mm in size, so the 9628 replacement blades should fit 9521 cutter. That is a fairly standard size for rotary cutter, so almost any 45mm blade should fit the cutting tool. My problem with the Fiskar 5 pack is that they are pressed tightly together with an oily substance. The edge is extremely sharp and they are difficult to separate safely.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are these scissors really hard to open?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes I find it hard to open as I have small hands ( 5.5\" from base of palm to middle finger). If I use one hand to open comfortably the widest gap between the tip of the blades is &lt;1\", so to make it functional I have to stretch my 4 fingers and the thumb to pry open up the handle.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it work well on silk? I'm planning to embroider some of my silk blouses and I worry about the pencil coming off. Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Jacqueline, I am not sure about silk. I know it doesn't rub off while working on a project, however, sometimes you need to use a lightly damp cloth to remove the marks. On silk ... well you know, water may leave a water mark on silks or satins. I love these pencils and haven't really tried them on silk. If you purchse them, take a sample piece of your fabric and test it out first. At Joann Fabrics, I also bought chalk pencils, see if you can find them in your area, or here on Amazon. Like these pencils, you can sharpen them to a fine point. Chalk just brushes off. Good Luck.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How well does it work for embossing?\n Answer:","completion":" It does work, however you will need to mix it with a clear embossing powder. It sounds like a pain, but it really isn't. You can get a large bottle of ultra thick clear powder and mix it with these pigment powders and have beautiful results. I have done it myself. I bought this set mistaking them for embossing powders. So with some experimenting, I found you can create beautiful embossing in these great colors. I purchased a set of clear screw top containers to store the mixed powders. I use tiny spoons to scoop the powders and stir. I am still experimenting, but I mix about 2 scoops of clear powder to 1 scoop of the pigment powder, stamp my image, sprinkle my mixture, add some heat and make terrific looking images. These pigments are extremely fine and powdery, so make sure the paper you stamp is static free by using a dryer sheet or one of those special stamping bags to wipe your paper before stamping. If you have used the right mix, you will not have any left over residue and will be able to dump the extra powder back in the container.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Has anybody used this in paint, finishes or buffer wax? TIA!\n Answer:","completion":" I've used this mixed with CA glue to fill voids on custom turned pens and also mixed in resin to make pen blanks. I would fear the pigments in paint would not allow this to show through. BUT, it may alighlty allow some of the \"shimmer\" to show through and give a nice affect.

{"prompt":"Question: Would this cut 1\/4\" thick foam rubber?\n Answer:","completion":" You'd have to turn it over and find the center hole again. I had a similar application (carpet tile). It wasn't always easy to get the hole lined up, but in the end it was worth it for the perfect circles.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this be used for cutting 1\/8\" veg-tanned leather?\n Answer:","completion":" I have not used this on leather; however, I think 1\/8\" thick piece might be at the limits as the edge of the blade as it lies perpendicular is maybe a 32nd over an eighth of an inch.

Each leg pulls in the material and forms the pleat. The tape has holes in the channel for the legs of the drapery hook. These gather the pleat.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do you know if I could use this w\/ Stitch Witchery?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it might not stay fixed and begin to sag if the material attached has much weight to it. If used on a very light fabric it might work. In my case, I'll be using it with curtains I intend to attach at the very top to clip-ons on rods, so it might work for that. But for me, the time it takes to sew it on will let me know that it will be firm for as long as the curtains last.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how many pieces of paper does this kit make? can one kit be used with more than one child?\n Answer:","completion":" This is just the tools you need to make paper. You also need an old blender. You put old paper in the blender with water and blend it to a pulp. Then poor it into a rubber made tub. Next you dip the screen(hand mold) into the pulp and the paper pulp comes with it. The you carefully dump it out. It takes some practice but works really well. You may need to add extra water to your tub to distribute the paper pulp more evenly. You dont want a super thick paper in most cases. You can add sparkles or dried flowers and herbs to make really beautiful paper. One kit should be ok for multiple children. If you have alot of paper to dry put a sheet in a sunny place and dump your paper on it to dry.

{"prompt":"Question: is there any warranty with this product? How long should it last?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't believe there is a warranty. The Olfa is made of plastic and seems durable. I researched Olfa before I bought it and it is supposed to be the most comfortable, durable and long lasting. More so than Fiscars. I would buy it again.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this product good for cutting heavy duty leather?\n Answer:","completion":" I've only used it for quilting and it will cut through several thicknesses of cotton fabric. I just tried it on naugahyde ....not exactly heavy duty leather, but it cut right through it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: can you cut mat board with this?\n Answer:","completion":" Probably but message the manufacterer. You would surely meed to replace the blade.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be able to cut thru thin wood? Like balsa wood or 1\/8\" thick plywood for crafting?\n Answer:","completion":" In my opinion, this would not be heavy duty enough to cut thin wood. Of course, I only use this cutter on fabric. It would need to be tested.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i cut through leather with this?\n Answer:","completion":" I would definitely believe so, it is super sharp and can cut through 5 layers of cotton fabric\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm not a quilter...need something for miscellaneous sewing and craft products. Is it necessary to use this on a rotary mat? Thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" I would say most definitely. The rotary cutter is sharp and the mat is self healing. Other mats would have slices in them from the rotary cutter. You can use the rotary cutter to cut out patterns instead of scissors. I wouldn't attempt using any other cutting mat.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be spread very thin with a spatula (to model ruins of a wall in a diorama model)? If so, would I vary the liquid\/solid proportions?\n Answer:","completion":" I will be happy to answer your question the best I can. First, I would say Plaster of Paris is not like clay that you can control and define. Yet, when you add paper or other material (Amazon sells bandage-like material you use specifically for Plaster of Paris, if you want more definition, just look at the bottom of the screen for what Amazon suggests go along with it, to purchase) to the mixture. When it dries, it is somewhat heavy, depending on what you are making. I have made piniatas by wrapping the paper around a balloon and popping the balloon after it dries, for instance. If it is only the part of the diorama where the wall or walls are, maybe it would be easier to use wood filler. You can get it in tube-form also, and apply it by squeezing the tube and then use a spatula or even craft stick, which is like a popsicle stick only wider. If your diorama encompases a large area, as apposed to a smaller model, maybe the plaster of paris would be doable. Other parts of the scene may work for using the plaster also. If you are in the service now and they still have Arts & Crafts Centers on Post, you may be able to get just a little bit of the plaster and see how it works. Mixing a small amount at a time is best because it hardens fast. I am creating a shelving unit for my bathroom using boxes as a base, to adhere strips to. The fat lady hasn't sung yet, so will see how this works out. :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am making a craft that takes 1\/2 cup of plaster paris for each one. About how many cups would be in this box?\n Answer:","completion":" I would d=say about 4 cups maybe a bit more.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: once i make a mold using this, can i use it to lay down carbon fibers and or fiber glass materials? and do you need to add water to this?\n Answer:","completion":" Plaster of Paris is primarily for working with paper materials. If you test it with the carbon fibers or glass materials, be sure you have good protection on your hands. Water is always mixed with Plaster of Paris. It sets up very fast, so I advise to only mix what you plan to use right away. I think it is 1 c plaster of paris per 1 c water. Not sure. I haven't used mine in about 6 months. I tried it with cardboard, using newspaper strips over it. My next creation will be better, I am sure. Try googling for information on it. Whatever you make, consider using fire protectant on your finished project. It comes in a spray can.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: once i make a mold using this, can i use it to lay down carbon fibers and or fiber glass materials?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not know, I am sorry. I used mine to make \"Chalkboard\" Paint for use in the house. If the mold is dry, I would expect that you could do so. The carbon fibers and fiberglass should not stick to the mold. If you are worried about it, as previously done with Fiberglass, just put on a light coat of wax to avoid sticking.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to make a cast of a face? (I'm making a batman mask)\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, but making a mold for it would be where it could become difficult. With a little ingenuity it can be done, though. Give it plenty of time to dry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you use this to make a pinata\n Answer:","completion":" I've used this on several projects with much success, however I think given the weight and consistency it would most likely be too heavy for a pinata both in terms of shattering like ceramics and for sheer weight. There are however great products avail for paper mache, which typically holds together from a base of glue and corn starch or flour. Hope that helps and happy crafting!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anybody used this plaster of paris to make chalk paint? Is Plaster of Paris pure calcium carbonate?\n Answer:","completion":" 3 cups of water 3 cups of latex paint 1 cup plaster of paris\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many cups of plaster does it make?\n Answer:","completion":" as plaster of paris this is plaster on a thin mesh cloth- it's strips of plaster: thus it is hard to quantify how many cups of plaster it makes- this isn't powder\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: on a scale of 1-10 is the thimbles and the pin cushion good quality?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure how to compare them. The pin cushion is small, 1 1\/2 inches in diameter. We are using an older one that is larger & it's flat on the bottom instead of round. The thimbles look thin and it looks like they are made of aluminum. I hope this is helpful. The case is much more compact than the old one that it is replacing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions on the box? Do the big spools of thread come with it or are they miniature?\n Answer:","completion":" not sure on teh size of the box but you get both small and large spools of thread\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the outside dimensions of the box?\n Answer:","completion":" 7 1\/2 inches wide, 14 inches high and 17 1\/4 inches long. These are the outside dimensions of the sewing machine box. The sewing essentials container is ten inches high, ten inches long and six inches wide. I apologize for the error.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the bobbins fit Brother sewing machines?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they do fit my Brother LX2500, every now and then I'll find one that is a little loose on the top spindle you use to fill the bobbin, but I push a straight pin into the center between the spindle and the middle of the bobbin and it spins just fine.

{"prompt":"Question: Is thread in this kit cotton?\n Answer:","completion":" Good question! I bought this and overall I enjoy it. The thread is not great quality. It does tend to snag on some fabrics. I am not sure the makeup of the thread, but for the price - you would not expect top quality cotton. It is a fine started pack and once you are done with those spools, you can replace with cotton of your choice. It is a handy storage system.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: can I use mac makeup airbrush foundation with it and not have to worry abt it clogging&gt;&gt;&gt;\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Michelle, Im using this compressor for hobby purposes, not for make-up brushing, I do spray acrylics which are pretty dense without a problem but to be honest I don't know if 35 psi's of output pressure will be enough for your needs. Best regards.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use these brushes with water only? What about with a disinfectant solution? I'm a barber so maybe that can help you understand.\n Answer:","completion":" While I am not an expert, I am a professional makeup artist, and one of the main reasons I went with this airbrush was because you can use it with many different mediums: alcohol based, water based, silicone based. I would see no reason why you would have to use water only, or why you couldn't use a disinfectant solution as well. Good luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: There are several complaints about lack of pressure adjustment. Can I use this with a separate regulator? Seems like that should solve the problem.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you can. If you use an external regulator I also recommend placing an accumulator tank between the regulator and compressor. I use a 70 cu in Bimba tank purchased from a surplus shop for my accumulator. It also keeps the compressor from cycling on as frequently.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this compressor only work for Iwata airbrushes, or can I use it with other types like Badger? Does it have good and enough pressure to do the job\n Answer:","completion":" You can get an adapter for other airbrushes. The compressor comes with an adapter for Paasche and Badger airbruses. The compressor is small, provides good pressure, but cannot be run for too much over an hour without the motor heating up. This compressor is very quiet.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this strong enough for the occasional tire inflation? I plan to use for airbrush, but it'd be nice to use for other tasks.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think it would work well to inflate a tire. You'd need an adapter for one thing, and I think the total pressure produced is probably too low. I'd recommend you buy a combination tire inflator\/battery jumper and keep it in your car.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it only work for single action guns or also for dual action?\n Answer:","completion":" It works great for the two airbrushes I use, a Paasche Talon and an Iwata Eclipse HP-BS. Both are dual action.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with a dual action spray gun or single action?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine did not come with a spray gun of any kind. Although the photo shows the compressor with a spray gun, there is not one included. It does seem a bit deceptive, but you will not find a spray gun in the description.\n"}

I have the Sotar backordered... anyone know what's going on?\n Answer:","completion":" All of Badger's production right now is going toward backordered products. Be patient, I ordered my Sotar 2020 2F on back-order too, and it shipped in about 3 weeks. For the excellent $78 price on Amazon Vs. the usual $300 price tag, it's well worth the wait. The complete line of Minitaire paints for $130 is another steal worth waiting for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the size of needle and tip in . mm \/ also what is the finest tip i can get for this airbrush\n Answer:","completion":" In a discussion about 2 years ago with Herman Robisch, the designer of the Sotar airbrush at Badger, I was told the fine tip is .2mm, the medium .45mm, and the large .7mm. The one body can be converted to the different sizes by buying the needle, paint tip (nozzle), and regulator of a given size. For a review of the Sotar and many other airbrushes, search for Don's Airbrush Tips.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this airbrush connect to a Compressor\/hose that has standard 1\/8\" BSP fittings?\n Answer:","completion":" Only after you get an adapter to fit the badger threads first. There is an adapter that first screws onto the threads on the airbrush. Then a standard 1\/8 hose will fit. You can find the adapters here or on ebay for cheap. I use an adapter and then a quick connect screwed to that. Works perfectly. The airbrush is sweet and I really like the results I get with it. www.facebook.com\/vondad check the albums. The true fire was done with the sotar. Best of luck to you.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Embroidering multiple words: Do I need the additional software in order to embroider multiple words with a space between?\n Answer:","completion":" Well, I know I have done more than one word at a time, but for the life of me I can't remember where I found out how to do it. I don't remember completely, but I think maybe I used a \"comma\" in place of the space. Then, before I began stitching, I think I hit \"Multicolor\". This way the machine stops after each letter, I think. Then when the comma comes up, you can hit the \"Forward One Color\" button, and it will skip the comma and leave the space. Now, it has been a year since I tried this, and my memory isn't like it used to be (ha), so make sure to try this on a scrap piece of fabric and see if it works. I could be completely wrong, but this would be worth a try. I know it's a hastle for it to stop after each letter, but that actually worked better for me, as it seemed to bunch up my fabric when I didn't stop after each letter. I cut the thread after each letter too, if I remember correctly. Anyway, I do know you can do it somehow, and you don't have to purchase additional software to do it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to repair the automatic threader or bypass it\n Answer:","completion":" I can't help, I can only commiserate because this was a terrible design and one they quickly removed from their production of these machines but we owners are still stuck with a machine that is practically unusable. We need a class-action lawsuit. I have tried every way possible to bypass that cassette. Nothing works. Some cassettes work better than others. Some thread 'weights' (thicknesses or brands) work better than others. Make sure you absolutely have the threading correct. The instruction manual shows it threaded differently than the decal on the cassette itself. Good luck.\n"}

The files loaded onto the card from the computer software with no problem, but I got the message \"This card can not be used on this machine.\" After playing around with it, I found that for it to work I need to be sure that I only save them to the card with the 4\" x 4\" \/ 4 1\/4\" x 4 1\/4\" hoop selected. I get the error message if I select either of the bigger hoop sizes, even if the design itself is small enough to fit. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: SmartBox: on a brother sewing machine review you said something about a smartbox what is this?\n Answer:","completion":" I would imagine that like its peers, the Amazing Box and the Ultimate Box, the Smart Box is a read\/write device that transfers digitized embroidery designs and images to and from your computer and rewriteable card.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the largest hoop size you can embroider? My current machine will do 5 x 7 but I can't find any more info about this one having anything larger\n Answer:","completion":" The hoop size for this machine is 4 x 4. That's the largest it will be. CORRECTION: My machine came with a 4 x 4 frame. I just checked my manual a frame up to 4 x 6-7\/8 is optional. Therefore my first reply is incorrect.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Tangled thread while embroidering: Does anybody else have problems with the thread tangling underneath while embroidering?\n Answer:","completion":" this happens to me too, try to set the tension to 0, and then add another layer of fuse backing, see if that helps, as it did for me, but not for the disney character Mickey mouse, will add another layer to see what happens. It looks like these type of designs create bigger looping underneath\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Automatic threader: What could I be doing wrong?\n Answer:","completion":" The threader is VERY finicky. The presser foot position doesn't really make a difference, but it seems to work better when its raised. Make sure the needle is in the UP position. You can tell this by the green light on the cartridge spot when the cartridge is removed. Thread tension is very important. Be sure that the thread exits the spool exactly as shown on the cartridge (the thread should unspool from the left side of the spool, not the right). Make sure the orange spool cap is not too tight against the top of the spool. It isn't necessary for the spool to rotate to work properly but it is necessary for it to pull freely. Once you've threaded the cartridge past position 5, make sure the thread moves freely without snagging then wrap it around the cutter. The thread has to \"stick\" in the cutter for it to work properly, this is because the threader grabs the thread from the loop BEHIND position 5. Finally make sure you push the cassette down firmly at an even pace. The biggest problem with the threader working is incorrect tension (too much) with the thread coming out of the cassette. You may also find that you'll get better results by bypassing placing the thread inside the cassette completely and using the spool pin instead. ===== Been a while since I looked at this thread. I don't use the SE270D much any longer, I upgraded to the Innovis-4500D. But before I did that I found a FOOLPROOF trick for the automatic threader: 1. Make sure you've threaded the cassette properly as I described above. 2. Push down SLOWLY on the thread cassette cartridge. 3. As you push down SLOWLY, you will see a little arm begin to extend toward the needle. Examine this arm closely and ensure that the thread follows the path down the arm across the fork-shaped hook and back up the arm. If the thread doesn't already cross the fork, you're already going to fail, release the cassette and let it pop back out. Remove it and rethread it and try again. 4. If you threaded the cassette properly and pushed slowly down on the cassette, in almost every case you will see the thread cross over the fork. When you've confirmed that begin to press faster. When the arm makes contact with the needle another arm will spring down quickly and push the thread from between the for through the eye of the needle. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My Machine keeps reading safety device in place\n Answer:","completion":" Is it making a noise? Does it still sew? I have had it do this when a needle was not put in as far up as it will go or the needle is slightly bent. Also once it did this and the shuttle cock was scratched badly and had to be replaced.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between the Class 15 and the Class 15J; are they interchangeable?\n Answer:","completion":" \"Class 15J Bobbins. Are you familiar with the class 15J bobbin? This is a special class bobbin used in the Singer 7400 series of machines, as well as the Futura (CE-100) and Quantum Futura (CE-200). Do not use regular class 15 bobbins in these machines, they will cause tension problems and can damage the bobbin case. The 15J is slightly smaller than the regular class 15, and the edges have a slight curve towards the center. The part number for this bobbin is 085128.\" I'd call the machine manufacturer to clarify 15 vs 15j and what one your machine needs, as they are not interchangeable.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does the lid snap on tightly so paints don't leak out or dry out?\n Answer:","completion":" The lid fits easily on and off but it is not a tight fit that \"snaps on\". If you keep your palette level, the paints will not leak out. I generally add a little water to the wells about a half hour before I start to paint, or you could add some when you are finished before you put the lid on. I have used this palette for a number of years and have been happy with it, but I am a studio painter and generally do not transport this palette. There are, however, large canvas bags with a space for the palette in the bottom if you need to take it in the car or something.\n"}

Hope this helps you...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the dimensions? The size is not listed. I can't buy it or replacement paper if I don't know the size!\n Answer:","completion":" it is 7\" x 8 1\/2\" and the Masterson Sta-Wet Acrylic papers fit perfectly. I couldn't find a sponge replacement that size so I cut one of the large ones to fit. it keeps the acrylics moist for several days and I spray them occasionally to help keep them wet. I don't get to paint every day so that helps. I like the small palette better than the big one for small paintings, which I do more often, as it is easier to open and close and keep at hand. hope that helps !\n"}

I like it keeps my acrylic paint wet for a long time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: IS this for oil paint as well?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think that this pallette is good for oil paints. It is supposed to be kept wet and that isn't useful for oil paints. I would buy a pallette specificly for oil paints if I were you. I hope that this answers you question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i run a photo through it without damage the photo\n Answer:","completion":" if you are using the laminate cartridge you can't take it off without ruining the photo. if you are just wanting make it a sticker then the front of the photo shouldn't be damaged but you can't remove the adhesive without damage. if it is an irreplaceable photo then your best bet is to make a copy and use the copy for your project and keep the original as is. Walmart and other such places usually have scanners to scan in photo's if the image isn't on a memory card but that kinda ruins the charm of old photos. If it is an old photo and your wanting to keep the 'rustic charm' then you might try a local photography studio and see if they can duplicate the method of printing. It just occurred to me that my response didn't really answer the question about running a photo through the machine but rather what happens to it after it has gone through. So to give a more complete response... as far as placing a photo in the machine and turning the crank it should be no problem. regardless of the type of cartridge, the photo would be sandwiched between two layers as it goes through the machine. Obviously the double sided laminate will adhere to the top and bottom. The magnetic cartridge may do the same since the top layer is thicker than what is used on the adhesive only cartridges (I just recently got the magnetic). The top layer on the adhesive cartridges is very thin and peels back removing the excess adhesive around your project leaving the project still attached to the 'waxy' bottom layer. Hope this is more helpful and my apologies for my over-site.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the thickness of the double sided laminate?\n Answer:","completion":" It's not especially thick. Things that are not very thick or are flimsy will come out just slightly thicker.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the unit come with a cartridge or do I have to order one at the time of order?\n Answer:","completion":" The unit comes with 1 sticky cartridge\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What length is the cartridge that comes preloaded when you buy it? Is it the full 40 ft?\n Answer:","completion":" No it is not a full 40ft cartridge.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone tried using this on ribbon?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It works very well but the cut of the ribbon is very important so it doesn't fray\/unravel upon removal from the backing paper. I like to use my pinking shears or an angular cut.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used for my art projects i made? Like tissue paper, charcoal, oil panting, and other art sketchs?\n Answer:","completion":" Tissue paper No...it would be too thin to use but I am an artist and if you wanted to do mixed media it can be used for other papers. I have used it for card stock type, 90-140lb papers. It adds a glue dimension to the back if you use that cartridge. Laminating has to be at least as thick as computer paper or similar.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What color is the adhesive? Transparent? Because i want to use on clear film but i am wondering is the adhesive might show on the film?\n Answer:","completion":" I use this adhesive on the back of photo prints and it appears to be clear but not sure it is see-through clear. So I would suspect it would be cloudy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use thick shimmer paper to make fancy mailing labels for wedding invitations. I am not sure if I would cut them out first (with a large paper punch) or if I would want to make the whole page a sticker, then punch them out. My question is,...\n Answer:","completion":" The answer is \"yes\". However, peeling off the backing may be more difficult if you punch before you peel. Why don't you experiment with a 6 x 6 inch piece of paper to see how it would work. Also, the thickness of your paper might (or might not-again, experiment) affect how well the labels will go through the mail.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will the permeate stick to cardboard , medal, and plastic bags, if so can I apply them in the cold or dose it have to warm for them to stick ?\n Answer:","completion":" i love this product. I have the 9\" and the 2.5\". I have made stickers to stick to cardboard, I am turning different papers into stickers and stick on top of each other in order to decorate boxes. I have done ribbon on ribbon. I am getting ready to cut paper in designs and fold and top the plastics bags with goodies in them. I have not done metal - but can't image you can't stick something to metal. you do nothing but feed your paper or fabric or ribbon through the easy feeder. It comes out the other side with a cover over your object and then it sticks to a piece of paper and you peel it off. Utilize the 9\" space as much as you can. You can feed several things through at one time. Pay attention to the length of the cartridge. I can't remember what came with it. But I have purchased an additional that has 40 feet on it. I hope that answers your question. Please ask me other questions if you want.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone give a rough percentage of how much it shrinks once dry? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" It doesn't shrink much but it is so crumbly and fragile that it is literally useless once dry. I dried it very slowly too, in a plastic bag with a few holes to ventilate. I am going to be looking elsewhere for a self-hardening clay.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone tried painting on the clay? If so, what type of paint works well?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes!!!! any kind I am sure will work...

{"prompt":"Question: How delicate is the sculpture once dry? I'm concerned about cracking.\n Answer:","completion":" I found about 9% shrinkage in the clay. It will be about a 70% chance of surviving the kiln. The longer\/dryer you get the clay the less it will Crack when fired. Overall it is a very good clay as far as wet clay is concerned. Crack free clay would be non sulphur based oil clay. But you don't fire it. You cast it in silicone\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long does clay take to completely dry\n Answer:","completion":" Drying time will depend on the size and thickness of the object. We do advise that the item is allowed to dry slowly and evenly on all sides at room temperature and away from heat until hard. During drying, rotate the object occasionally to ensure that all surfaces are exposed to the air.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: best climate to dry this clay\n Answer:","completion":" When clay dries it tends to get very cold. If you are in a very dry and hot environment, cracking may occur.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the color of the grey Marblex self-hardening clay a soft grey, dark grey, blue grey, greenish grey?

I'm sure the wood of the drawer measures out to 1 1\/2\" deep, but the metal tray takes just a little bit off that depth. The pallet fits inside with a very small amount of play, so effectively it is the same dimension as the drawer.\n"}

I lost one of the key pieces of hardward for the third leg, emailed Mabef in Italy along with photos, and the customer service sent me the missing piece.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this product work well with taking photographs and making stickers out of them? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, but you might want to consider the 5 inch Xyron Create a sticker (or larger) as this one is only 2 1\/2 inches wide. If your photos are larger than 2 1\/2 in you'll definitely want a bigger one. But commenting on the Xyron products in general, I love them! They are the fastest and easiest way to apply adhesive to the backs of items.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much waste is involved? It seems there is a huge leader and footer when you put the items through. Is it cost effective?\n Answer:","completion":" You can reduce waste by positioning the machine so that you can see the area as your item comes out and stop cranking the lever as soon as it has cleared the machine. If you have multiple items to put through the machine you can feed them in so the emerge in a continuous strip, placing each item very close behind the end of the preceding item. This method also reduces waste. Small\/narrow items can be placed side by side and run through that way also.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do I need to use the stickers that I make with this machine immediately, or can I save them for future craft projects?\n Answer:","completion":" You can save them as long as you don't peel them off of the strip they are stuck on when you crank them out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to make professional labels with my product name and ingredients on it. Do I print the text I need and what kind of paper do I use?\n Answer:","completion":" You can do that however I've found that slightly thicker paper tends to work better (less risk of tearing when removing it from the sticker sheet) but if you're very careful, it still works. Permanent adhesion is good. I placed some stickers on a file cabinet and then changed my mind and now I'll have to scrape the paper & glue off to remove them. So you don't have to worry about them falling off, that's for sure!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work to make beer bottle labels?\n Answer:","completion":" The permanent and removable glues probably won't stand up to water drenched bottles. They do sell permanent glue backing but doubt that is waterproof.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does the design get onto the sticker paper? Do I have to draw it on?\n Answer:","completion":" You place another piece of paper on it with your design and put it through the machine and the other side of that piece of paper will be sticky.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: At what temperature is this baked at per inch of thickness? Can it be safely reheated after baking?\n Answer:","completion":" Sculpting tools should be dedicated to clay work and should never be used for food afterwards. That includes rolling pins, baking sheets, and knives. Super Sculpey * Super Sculpey should be cured in a preheated 275 F (130 C) oven for 15 minutes per quarter inch of thickness. DO NOT MICROWAVE. For example, a piece of \" thickness would be cured for 30 minutes. The layering method is recommended for lager pieces of construction. Premo * Premo! Sculpey should be cured at 275 F (130 C) in a preheated oven for 30 minutes per quarter inch of thickness. DO NOT MICROWAVE. Once cured, the colors intensify and deepen. Sculpey III * Sculpey III should be cured in a preheated 275 F (130 C) oven for 15 minutes per quarter inch of thickness. DO NOT MICROWAVE. If you're unsure whether your piece is adequately cured, try pressing the tip of a fingernail into the bottom of your piece after it has cooled; it will leave a mark but will not actually enter the clay. Fimo * Any home oven is suitable for hardening FIMO. Preheat the oven at 110C\/230F. Place the FIMO model on an aluminum sheet, and plate or glass sheet and put it in the oven. Depending on teh size of the model and the thickness of the walls, the hardening process takes approx. 20-30 minutes. FIMO reaches maximum hardness when completely cool. Prosculpt * Cured at 275 F (130 C), this clay can be used in a household oven. For every 1\/4 inch of thickness, it should be cured for 10 minutes. Kato Clay * Kato Polyclay, oven hardening polymer clay, bakes at 300 F (150 C). However, it can also be cured at 275 F (135 C) with good results and has been approved to cure at 350 F by our toxicologist, however caution should be taken when curing at that temperature, time should be limited to 10 minutes as you will run the risk of discoloration. You should never exceed 365 F. In prior laboratory testing, it has been determined that tensile strength increases You can reheat but be careful of scorching. if your item is too thick, use a filler material such as foil and wrap the clay around it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between this Sculpey white and the super sculpey beige? There is quite a difference in price between the two of them?\n Answer:","completion":" Sculpey white is a softer clay than Super Sculpey, which makes it easier to work with. Super Sculpey can be easier to sand and manipulate after baking because of its denser consistency. Super sculpey is over ten dollars a pound while white sculpey is about five dollars a pound.Good luck.\n"}

I am completely self taught and still have this machine after 7 years, and I do use it quite a lot! Read the manual very carefully and always consider checking online for tutorials and instructions on basic sewing. I highly recommend to save yourself some troubleshooting that you always change needles with each project to the proper weight and type of needle and only use Gutterman or Metteler brand thread. (Don't use Coats & Clark or dollar store\/cheap thread, cuz it will break and wind itself on the inside of your machine.)\n"}

Just a couple of bobbins, a zipper foot and maybe a couple other things. I've had several sewing machines over the years, this is a good one. You will have to supply your self with a few things for your sewing basket, but don't buy anything until you really think you will need it. Basics will be a seam ripper, some pins, scissors, that's really about it. Don't buy machine needles, it comes with a few and you could easily get the wrong size. Take one of those with you to match it up. The instruction sheet in a pattern will guide you in any thing else you may need. Hope this helps.\n"}

Well, I've discovered that if before pressing the pedal you lower the needle (by rotating the wheel towards you) until it's in a low position (either near the fabrick, or sticking a bit into it), then the machine will start, slowly, if you press the pedal slightly...You won't need to press a lot, and it will be easier to control speed. I hope this will be useful to people having this problem with this machine...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this fabric white or off-white?\n Answer:","completion":" To my eyes it is white. I placed it against a few pieces of paper and fabric as a test, and it is white to me. I really have had nothing but positive experiences with this product. I would not recommend the twill, however. It is thicker and does not produce as clear of a picture or whatever you are printing. Hope this is helpful to you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between the poplin and the twill? Is one better for certain uses over the other? What are your preferences? Thanks in advance.\n Answer:","completion":" I have never used the twill. I quilt and the poplin is very close to the cotton fabric. I did a memory quilt for my mom with lots of photographs. Turned out better than I thought for my first time! This was very easy to use in the printer. I would cut it before printing to keep from wasting so much or fit smaller pictures one piece and cut it after printing. Good luck. Varies in price so search for the best one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What exactly do they mean by \"hand wash\"? What detergent, if any can be used? Can I use the hand wash cycle in front loading washing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, I use a lot of this fabric for various projects and yes, I use the handwash cycle in my washer.. and cold water, but then I wash most of my clothes in cold water. Also, when you have finished adding the image to your Photo Fabric, give it a good ironing with a nice hot iron. This really seals the color into the fabric. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Should you use bubble jet set before printing?\n Answer:","completion":" No. The fabric is pre-mounted on backing paper. I print, iron the printed fabric to help set the ink, wait for a day, and then remove the backing and rinse in Bubble Jet Rinse or another mild detergent to help further set the ink.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need to cut the roll, or can you print along the entire roll, in one long print? (For example, for a panoramic photo.)\n Answer:","completion":" I have never printed bigger than a4. I suppose it will depend on the settings or printing on and what your printer is capable of\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you wash on gentle cycle and dry on low? I am using this to make craft tags for gifts, the items are wash and dry but will the tags hold up?\n Answer:","completion":" It ravels easily but after you take care of that, it should be washable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to make handkerchiefs for a wedding. Will this fabric work for that? Is it too thin? Unraveling along the sides is fine.\n Answer:","completion":" It may be a little stiff. It is not thin, it has to be stiff enough to put though the printer. I made a queen size quilt using the wedding pictures and the brides color skim. It was beautiful. I have since brought more for memory quilts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to print images to be ironed onto T-Shirts and Mouse Pads?\n Answer:","completion":" This is more for pictures for a quilt. Like I am printing pictures and sewing a picture frame around the picture. I made a wedding quilt with her color as the frame This doesn't iron on there is no sticky on the back. There is an iron on for t shirts in the same brand\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you have to rinse and set after printing?\n Answer:","completion":" I did not....\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used it on polyester, like Nike Dri-Fit shirts?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the picture smooth like the shirt\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is. Just make sure if you are looking for transfer kind you get that one. The one I got is great but it's for quilts and I'm sewing it on tshirts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use a laser printer even though it says ink jet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes....but you will need to seal your fabric over after the image is printed as it will not hold! I covered mine with a gel medium and that worked, but an ink jet is definitely better!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do instructions for use come with the product?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, rolled up on the inside of the tube holding the fabric there is a sheet of paper giving you instructions on how to use the photofabric with your inkjet printer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Ink smeared when I rinsed in water as instructed. Waited a day before to insure ink was dry. How can you stop this from happening?\n Answer:","completion":" I also waited a day. I heat set it after it dried and then I rinsed it in cold water and heat set it again!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone washed this without Bubble rinse? Do the colors fade?\n Answer:","completion":" I have never washed it. Sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this suitable to make labels with?\n Answer:","completion":" Have not used it yet. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to print a photo and text onto black and white shirts-- does this product have any restrictions for that?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure of your question. The material is like any other. You can apply the material to shirt by sewing it or adhesive.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you feed the roll through an inkjet printer?\n Answer:","completion":" You don't feed the entire roll. You can cut it to any length up to 11\" long, making it the same size as standard paper, if that's the maximum size that your printer will handle. You save on waste, by being able to cut smaller lengths, as necessary. I usually print my design out in a trial run, in greyscale, or draft mode, on regular paper, to see how large the design is, then cut the fabric appropriately. Hope this answers your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how does it work?\n Answer:","completion":" Its simple. Cut a strip, dip it I'm water for a few second, shake off the excess water, apply it and smooth it out. I love this stuff\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where is this made in?\n Answer:","completion":" The packaging did not specify but they have a website liste in the packaging called www.castingkeepsakes.com. You may be able to find out there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I dispose of water used to wet plaster?\n Answer:","completion":" I just dump the water on my lawn and rinse out the residual.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this for making a pi&ntilde;ata?\n Answer:","completion":" I have not. I have used it as a substrate for encaustic work. Good luck with your project.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many rolls come with this order?\n Answer:","completion":" One but it goes a long way. I made three 5-inch sculptures with it and still have plenty left. I really like the product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: After it has dried, is it easy to cut? Want this for a craft project for 1st graders, they will need to cut it AFTER it has hardened\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't try to cut it after it dried. I wet it and then put it over a aluminum foil sculpture. It worked great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can more than one kids face mask be made with one roll?\n Answer:","completion":" I used this to make hand casts, don't think just one of this sized rolls would work for more than one face\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i read that plaster of paris has chemicals and isn't very safe on skin or around the face? any truth to that?\n Answer:","completion":" Skin sensitivity can vary and plaster (or any gypsum product) can irritate skin with prolonged exposure (most commonly by drying out the skin). It is recommended to use a skin barrier such as petroleum jelly or other thick lotion type substance before applying bandages. This also helps it from sticking to hair. The concerns you've heard about are probably related to the exothermic reaction of plaster. While plaster is reacting with water, it heats up. However, the small amounts of plaster (gypsum) in bandages heats up almost unnoticeably. Never immerse any part of your body directly into liquid gypsum.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it sew blue jeans\n Answer:","completion":" More important than the material, is the needle and the thread. You need to use either size 16 or 18 needle for denim and heavy materials. Slow down the speed when sewing, this is not the top of the line, heavy duty machine. Going too fast can break needles, thread, even gears inside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Comparison with Brother LS2125i: Is the Brother LS2125i anyway better than this model?\n Answer:","completion":" I think the biggest difference is the 4-step buttonholer on this machine and the 10 stitches versus the one-step buttonholer and 25 stitches on the 2600. The stitch length, width and thread tension are also preset for you on the lower end model. It's worth the $16 for the high end model because 4-step buttonholer is a pain and requires a lot of patience. Also, if there is no stitch or thread tension adjustments you can make yourself, you are stuck trying to work around problem materials on the machine without any way of adjusting the machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you fill the bobbin\n Answer:","completion":" The bobbin is filled in the \"traditional\" way -- not in the bobbin case. You put the bobbin on the little post on the right on the top of the machine, push it to the right to disengage the needle from going up and down, thread the thread through the hole in the top of the bobbin, and start the machine. When the bobbin is full, you remove it and put it in the bobbin case, beneath the plate by the presser foot, and return the bobbin-winding post to the left position, which re-engages the sewing action.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the Brother XL2600I come with a foot pedal?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is self-threading? My eyesight is declining.\n Answer:","completion":" Oh My Goodness, easy, easy, easy and fast...This is the only machine that I can actually use self threading...I'm with you with the eyesight problem...but I tell you, that is one of my best features for me because I can't see those darn small needles but yes its very easy to do on this model\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: denim\n Answer:","completion":" You can sew denim, but only two layers, and never try to hem over the heavy flat-felled side seams of ready made jeans. That is too heavy for this machine. But for the two layers, use a heavy duty thread and a heavy needle, size 16 or even a size 18. These are not special needles, just heavier ones available at stores, and wouldn't come in your spare needle pack with the machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Just purchased this for my teenage daughter, are there other items I should get to go along with the machine when I give it to her ? Thanks so much.\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased extra bobbins and needles.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what the maximum thickness fabric can this model sewing? i am planing to make living room curtain which is thick material. can this model work out?\n Answer:","completion":" The model will work but try changing the needle to fit the fabric\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use it for machine embroidery projects?\n Answer:","completion":" This maching has only minimal programmed functions, so only basic pattern work can be accomplished. This machine would not serve well as embroidery project machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hello! This is will be my first sewing machine ever. What else do I need to purchase with it?\n Answer:","completion":" I think you should be all set with this machine. The bobbins and everything you need to get started should be included. This machine is easy to operate and thread. Best of luck! This is great for a first time buyer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use them with fondant?\n Answer:","completion":" I have no idea whether they would be food safe. They are not high relief or rigid, so I don't think they would be very good at making an impression in something as thick as fondant.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you use these with a machine or can you use them with a texture tool?\n Answer:","completion":" I use them with crayons and pencils for my elementary students when we study life science\/math. We identify and describe patterns and the kids make an animal skins book.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will these roll through a pasta machine?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't want to try. They'd probably crack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the actual size? How many in package?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say like 1 1\/2 or 2\" and 60\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the holes in these buttons large enough for my child to easily string a shoelace through?\n Answer:","completion":" The shoe lace on my sketchers would not go thru the holes and all the holes on the buttons are the same. I don't know if kids shoe laces are smaller, but mine did not go but 1\/16\" in the hole. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will the plastic kids needles used for yarn projects fit through the holes?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes I used a dog tag chain. Plenty of room\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can they laced on a pipe cleaner?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the holes aren't big enough\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are all the colors that are in this package? Just the ones in the picture?\n Answer:","completion":" Red, orange, yellow, pink, dark pink, green, light green, blue, purple, white and black. But each package is different. I only got the light green and dark pink after a second purchase.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many are there of each shape?\n Answer:","completion":" Seems to be random. I ended up with quite a few triangles, squares and circles but only one or two hearts and no pentagons.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the measurment of these buttons?\n Answer:","completion":" About 2\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: About how big are the buttons?\n Answer:","completion":" Nickle and Quarter size, if that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: so why the sudden increase in price since I added them to cart 3 days ago found someone else selling for 8.09\n Answer:","completion":" we have not changed our price\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: About how many buttons were in the package? I need 240 buttons.\n Answer:","completion":" Sorry, I didn't count them and have shared them so I can't go back. For sure more than 100.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: hoping to use these on a blackboard\/chalkboard. Do these wash off fully from blackboards?\n Answer:","completion":" As long as the chalkboard has been primed with chalk prior, they do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are the tips fine?\n Answer:","completion":" Not as fine as a sharp tipped sharpie marker.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would this work well on my mirror? I wanted to write on my mirror closet doors\n Answer:","completion":" Yes..however, some colors might be brighter than others.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these show up on\/be easily erasable from a standard black refrigerator?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. We use them on dark blue. They show up well and erase easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: car windshiels? if yes how do you erase them?\n Answer:","completion":" They are water soluable. I use them on my bathroom mirror and wash them right off with Windex so I'm going to assume yes on the windshield\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these be used to decorate glass windows?\n Answer:","completion":" They should be able to. I use them on a plastic LED Message board from Spencer's with no issues. Just wet whatever you're using to erase them afterwards.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this work on foluresant boards like you would find in resturant to let you know the specials of the day\n Answer:","completion":" I think they would work on a fluorescent board: they wipe off with a wet cloth and the paint is smooth on application.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm thinking about getting these for a contact paper chalk board, does anyone know if this will leave residue?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this have a handle?\n Answer:","completion":" It has a spot to grab it (think car door handle like) but not a handle like on say a lunchbox. Hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it hold 12 x 12 paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is perfect for 12x12 paper!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the interior dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" 12 3\/4 x 13 1\/4\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it store 11x14 paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Oops. This case is different than the one I store my 11 X 14 art paper inside. This particular case is a very tight fit for 11 X 14 paper, and I would not use it for that purpose. A better case for that is http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B005P1S7NQ which has sloping sides so you'd need to put something smaller under the paper but that one accomodates 11 X 14 paper in the top half of the compartment.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it fit manilla folders?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you can put letter sized manilla folders in this box. It has room enough and to spare for several folders, final quantity depending on how thick your stack of papers happens to be. I consider the box to be too large for that purpose though, because there is room enough for loose contents to slide out of such folders. If your papers are fastened into the folders, then the box might suit your purpose.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions of this case?\n Answer:","completion":" In the product details you can find the Product Dimensions: 2 x 14.2 x 15.5 inches. This is the outside dimensions of the case. I assume you're more interested in the inside dimensions; but I have not measured the case inside. I use it to hold a variety of things, all related to doing embroidery. The largest item I store there is my 12 inch diameter embroidery hoop. I cannot put another embroidery hoop of the same size on top of the four already in the case because it would not close and latch, but a hoop smaller than my 6 inch one would nest inside the others. Due to the way the handle is formed, you won't be able to fit anything much larger than 12X12 paper inside. Because of the slim design, nothing much deeper than 1.5 inches would fit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this box made from polypropylene?\n Answer:","completion":" I really like mine. Good size and quality.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I just received this unit. Never used one before. filled the jar with water and set pressure at 30 psi. air blows out, but no liquid. Whats up?\n Answer:","completion":" When you push the trigger down air is let out pulling back on the trigger should release the water. if this does not happen unscrew the back end of the brush and loosen the retaining ring for the needle and adjust the needle till the right flow is obtained. Trigger down in forward position no flow as you pull the trigger back flow should increase. hope this helps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the paint supposed to spray slowly? i can't get a heavy paint coat on the surface.\n Answer:","completion":" You have to thin it down. I use a ratio of 1 part paint to 3 parts thinner.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where can i find a Detailed manual on how to use this brush?\n Answer:","completion":" ojait2 The brush comes with instructions if you are at all familiar with double action air-brush, they are all basically the same. good for small work. Will need air compressor with adjustable pressure. Also look at Badger air brushs\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This may sound weird but I am looking to use this as a makeup applicator! Can this be achieved with this unit!?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely that us how we are using it for Stage Makeup, works wonderfully\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hola, has bent this one the compressor included???\n Answer:","completion":" no, the compressor is not included\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what parts typically wear down first? and are there replacement parts?\n Answer:","completion":" Trigger breaks pretty easy, the plunger valve or the air supply sticks on occasion, keep it clean. I have found parts for this specific air brush, but I found a badger brush that looks almos identical... I ordered parts for the badger and they worked on this one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is causing paint to leak from the spray jar?\n Answer:","completion":" Usually its the troubleshoot. The trigger may need replaced\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the maximum psi that should be used?\n Answer:","completion":" I am so sorry it took so long to reply. I gave this as a gift & I tried to contact the person, but was unable to. So, I do not have an answer for you-I am sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you widen the spray pattern?\n Answer:","completion":" one a week\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: has anyone else had problems getting thinned paint to spray from the glass jar?\n Answer:","completion":" I had issues after I took apart the gun for cleaning, I had the tip screwed in too tight. Try loosening it and it should work\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the machine capable of a basting stitch? I see that the stitch length\/width cannot be adjusted...\n Answer:","completion":" The machine has 3 straight stitch settings, 6 stitches per inch, 10-11\/inch and 18\/inch. If I need to baste, I just use the 6 stitches per inch and loosen the tension slightly so I can pull the threads out when I am done. Hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone use this machine for quilting? Can you sew through thick layers easily while quilting?\n Answer:","completion":" I use it for thick layers. I take it to quilting class and I just finished a denim quilt made from old jeans\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easy is it to control the speed of the machine? Does it go fast by just lightly tapping on the foot controller? I need a machine that can go SLOW!\n Answer:","completion":" I guess it's normal. I use mine for quilt piecing and I have done some machine quilting on it. It seems to respond according to the pressure you put on the foot pedal. I love it. I have an electronic very high end machine I use for embroidery, etc. but this little guy is perfect for take along and quilting. Hope this helps. Mary\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is size of the machine?\n Answer:","completion":" The Gem Gold is 13\"x11\"x6\" and weighs 11 lbs. Perfect for 'taking along' to quilting meetings or classes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone tell me if this comes with a case\/cover and if so, the approximate outside dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it doesn't. I ordered a cover for mine. I ordered one on Amazon. Mine zips and has a handle where I can easily move it from one room to another. I looked at the measurements of the sewing machine and made sure the cover was larger.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have a light?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, when you turn the machine on it lights up, it is the most wonderful little sewing machine, I am really enjoying it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much does this sewing machine weigh? Thank\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure but I was told about 12 lbs. It is easy to pack around\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a drop in bobbin?\n Answer:","completion":" The bobbin loads from the side not from the top.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the wieght of this machine?\n Answer:","completion":" the machine weighs 11 lbs. my repair man said it wouldn't sew thru heavy weight or layers, but it sews fine thru 2 layers of cotton with batting or a heavy interface. I love it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you drop the feed dogs\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work well to dye a lab coat? Also, will it stain the washing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" The dye is only suitable for non synthetic fabrics, a 50\/50 poly cotton blend yes, fully poly no. Cotton that has not been treated is its primary use. You might consider using fabric spray paint dye, which will bond with synthetic fabrics. Any item you dye should be left to air dry for a few days, then you can wash it alone, it will bleed for the first few washed like a new pair of jeans. Also keeping the dye mix in a bucket and redying an item after its washed once, then repeating the process may be needed as the item may lighten, black is a dark color. So for any synthetic or polyester fabric spray paint is the way to go.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this dye work on polyester?\n Answer:","completion":" There are a number of interesting you tube videos that are very helpful. However, the color and the type of fabric that you are dying is critical. The closer that the fabric that you are dying is too 100 % natural fibers, like cotton or linen, the better the dye will take. The closer the color is the white the better it will take. I doubt that you can dye polyester. I think that the faded levis that I dyed are a good example. After dying, the blue part of the levi looked blue, but the white parts (these were very faded) on the seams etc. were almost as dark as the blue parts. The inside part of the pockets (white, but not cotton) came out a faded light blue and the orange stitching looked very orange. I hadn't even realized that the levis had orange stitching.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anybody tried this dye in a front loading washing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes I did, and will never do it again. Eventually after about 10 washes the navy dye I used faded from the machine. I complained to dylon and they sent me two items to get the colour from a wash I run after using the dye and looked very grubby. It did help but I did lose some items because they were really dull in colour. Just to let you know I would never use it again in any washing machine\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Which works the best,powdered or liquid dye?\n Answer:","completion":" liquid, FOR SURE\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many would I need to dye a cotton anorak?\n Answer:","completion":" One should be enough.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you think this would work on a canvas chair and is it liquid or powder thank you\n Answer:","completion":" It is a powder. I really can't say how it will work on canvas. It worked fine on muslin and there has been no color washout. Still dark black which was what was wanted.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: DO I NEED SODA ASH?\n Answer:","completion":" that was not a requirement per the directions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: bleach spots on bright red carpet--any suggestions\n Answer:","completion":" oh no...If they are small try a red permanent or paint marker close in color, if large spots... paint black or white with paint all over carpet, make squares, flowers, or swirls or western brands.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I used this on a cloth cap and went jogging, is it possible for the dye to \"bleed out\" because of sweat and end up coloring my skin on my forehead?\n Answer:","completion":" I used it on a cloth cap and, thus far, have had no problems. Now, to be fair, I DID wash the cap a few times right after dyeing in a cold wash to avoid bleed out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the colors be mixed?\n Answer:","completion":" I know I read on one of the sites that you can mix colors (try Dylon's web site, it might be there).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this work in a Brother XL 2600i ?\n Answer:","completion":" No, Don't waste your money!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will the bobbin fit stock numbers SA156,SFB:XA5539-151 for brothers machine\n Answer:","completion":" I bought a Brother Project Runway 70 decorative stitches from Amazon. Do not know the part number but the bobbin fits. there is not a lot of thread on the spool but the prewound bobbin, the bobbin itself with the matching thread was a pretty good deal I thought\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with a case or trays?\n Answer:","completion":" Very flimsey tray!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how much thread on spindle? bobbin? 100% cotton thread? dual duty thread?\n Answer:","completion":" Mel, This is only a guess, I will get back to you with details. Bobbin is 3\/4 full. I am guessing cotton, it's very soft. I will be using on a project soon and can check back in. I think this set it something that you would use for a repair or a small bit of work. Not much on the spindle and they are paper tubes. Best part was 64 wound bobbins.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will bobbins fit older Singer machines? I have model 9005, about 30 years old.\n Answer:","completion":" It will work since they are metal and look like the ones I used for my older machines\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these bobbins fit a brother sewing machine\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they will! I've put them on my machine and my aunt's Brother Sewing Machine and work just fine. I hope you will buy the Thread and Bobbin Kit because you won't be sorry!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Who makes the thread? Brand name?\n Answer:","completion":" There is no mention of the manufacturer or even that it is made in the USA. The thread looks and feels just like any of my other thread.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the biggest diameter it could cut?\n Answer:","completion":" There is no specific diameter that it cannot cut. Templates are always valuable in this respect, though. There are many templates available - especially if can get access to drafting or art supply outlets. If not, one can conceivably be creative and make\/or use ones own template. As mentioned in a prior answer, this \"gadget\" is a freeform cutter; can only cut thin sheets of paper and requires a bit of practice to be able to cut \"clean\" circles (or any other shape, for that matter).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can I use this with fabric\n Answer:","completion":" Although we have only used them to cut card stock, it seems they would be able to cut fabric.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you keep cutter press from jaming down\n Answer:","completion":" I have never had this problem. Sorry, I couldn't be of more help. Are you using it freehand or with a template?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used with non fiskars templates?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure but it barely works with fiskers templates so I doubt that it will work well with another brand. Personally this item was a waste of money. I love fiskers scissors and have always been happy with their products until purchasing this item\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this cutter be used with chipboard?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not experienced enough to know. Sorry. Also due to my lack of experience I did not have very good luck with this. I used the board that came with my Cuttlebug.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Sharpie paint pens: Is it safe to bake the oil based paint?\n Answer:","completion":" Hey Eileen- I'm not sure exactly which aspect of 'safe' you're looking for but i baked a plate that i had drawn on with an oil based sharpie- the only issue i had was that the deaign came out kind of speckled but since it was uniform throughout the design it was kinda cool, i haven't tried it again to see if it was a fluke or not- i've read that using the oil sharpies then baking makes the plates food & dishwasher safe- i don't know how true that is, but i've read it several places. I found your question because i'm making wine glasses tomorrow- some places say bake them & one said the heat will cause it to break-- i guess i'll find out tomorrow!! I hope this helped!\n"}

They stay on the copper long enough for the acid I use to do it's work, which is usually close to an hour. Hope this helps. Dawn\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will pens stick to oil painting canvas\n Answer:","completion":" Truthfully I'm not sure. I use them mostly for a resist when I am etching copper. I have used them to decorate acrylic glasses and I have used them on iron. So far everything I have used them on I have not had any issues with them. Just remember to shake them well before using them. Oh yea, I did have one issue. I needed to reshake one of them and got sidetracked and forgot to put the cap on. Remember to re-cap when shaking. lol I'm laughing now, but it wasn't so funny when I did it. Other than that I love these markers and will get more when they run out. Hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Brother PC 8500: Any suggestions on whee to get the 2.0 software require ?\n Answer:","completion":" I also have a PC8500. I think you misunderstood how this PED-basic works. Our 8500, unlike newer models, has no USB port or floppy disc slot or a CD slot. The only way to use embroidery designs is if they are on the small 2\" square card that fits into the side of the machine. This software doesn't need a floppy drive - it comes on a CD-ROM. The little box and USB cable takes embroidery patterns from the internet or from a CD on your computer and writes it to the Brother card that will work in your 8500. This enables you to use any .pes designs that are online or that are on CD's. It opens up a whole new world of designs, where in the past, we could only use the $60+ cards made by Brother. I'm going to buy one!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: when i download embroidery patterns, my computer cant open them or show what they are. will this software make my computer be able to see the design ?\n Answer:","completion":" no, this program is to load patterns to card to be put in the machine. I have had the same problem with some patterns, depending on who I purchase them from. The only thing I can come up with is that depending on what program they use to write the pattern with and what I have on my computer, if they aren't the same, i have problems. however, I have found that if I save the pattern as I download as a 7-zip file, then open as a 7-zip and extract it to save to my \"embroidery file\", if I connect my machine by usb to the computer, I am able to load the pattern to my machine and use it. I save it to the machine, and am able to use files that won't open in my brother ped system. I have a friend who showed me how to use ped, and she has a computer with vista like I do, and she didn't have the same problem with opening from some vendors, and the only solution was praying and playing with the system until God helped me figure out how to make it work. Lots of tears of frustration before then. If you don't have 7zip on your computer, you can download for free, just be careful of all the extra stuff included, I declined all the other stuff as it popped up. I also went to default programs and set all of the zip files and pes to open with 7 zip after I downloaded it, and have been able to accomplish!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: whats the difference between this thread and regualr cotton thread?\n Answer:","completion":" I am no thread expert but there is a difference. This is polyester layered over polyester. 100% cotton thread has a different feel to it. I would suggest going to Hobby Lobby, Walmart, Joann Fabric or any other craft store and feel for yourself the difference between the coats and clark brand and other brands. Even though this is less expensive, in the long run it's more costly because it runs out quickly and it breaks, tangles, snags in your machine and almost all the time during hand sewing so you are basically using more thread and having to discard much of this thread. You get what you pay for. Coats and Clark is not the company it used to be. Now, all of their threads are made in Mexico. Cheap labor and sub-standard material. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this tread be used on jersey material?\n Answer:","completion":" I use it on nearly everything--including jersey. it seems course, but I have never had any problems with it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do the bristles come out when you paint?\n Answer:","completion":" No but the wooden handles did come out of the metal ferrules on the brushes from my set.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use these with oil based paints?\n Answer:","completion":" The packaging does not mention use with oil paint.

{"prompt":"Question: can you adjust the torso length itsself, not just its height. for example, the length from the hip to the shoulder. i am tall and i have a long torso.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you can. Lift the form off the stand. Look inside and you will see metal slats pull each connection until you get the length you need. The only thing wrong with doing this, is there becomes a gap and can not pin in this area. I had to adjust mine about 2 inches it is very tight and can be hard to do.\n"}

I pinned some fleece fabric to it and shaped it to match her figure. You can use any thick fabric or even batting. I just had the fleece on hand. In her case, I was able to make the bust line smaller, so that the under-bust would be her size. Then I got a bra in her size, put it on the form and filled it to fit her. It worked great. Since you can put pins in the form, it is easy to pad it.\n"}

I'm afraid you May have cross threaded it. Gently but firmly try to loosen it so you don't break it. If that doesn't work I would find a way to put the question in to Singer. Oh heat May help too. Like a microwave wet towel or heating pad wrapped around it for a bit, but nothing hotter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: medium covers what sizes?\n Answer:","completion":" Bust 33\" to 39\" Waist 25\" to 31-1\/2\" Hip 34\" to 40\" If you're within those measurements in all categories, then a medium should work just fine. Rather than looking at \"sizes,\" it's best to look at the actual measurements that the dress form can be adjusted to. And if you have one measurement that falls out of the ranges given above, it's probably best to order a size up or down respectively, as there is a bit of overlap on the extremes of each size. For example, the large can be sized down to the upper range of the medium.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the shoulder sizes on a dress form adjust? I have narrow shoulders compared to the rest of me. I would like to altar shoulders on store bought clothes also.

But I also had put white material around the top because I have a Dcup, so either color I could see colored pins. Best wishes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my bust size is a 32 but this is 33 and i cant find a small do you think one inch will make a difference? i cant decide if i should buy it\n Answer:","completion":" One inch can be a significant difference in clothing; however, if that is the only difference, I would seriously consider purchasing this. Ask yourself this: how tight do you want your clothing? If you can guarantee your measurements will never change and you want it skin-tight then do not make the purchase because you will be seriously disappointed but if you are like the rest of the world, I would buy it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how large does the brest, waist, and shoulders go?\n Answer:","completion":" Bust ...46\" waist...37\" hips...46\" However you can add to it even more if need be. With foam and or batting. Even a simple stuffed bra can work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size do I buy?\n Answer:","completion":" Well what size are you? Measure your bust, hips and waist, then match the ones in the description. I'm usually an XL so this one worked for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between the large and the small size? If it's adjustable, shouldn't the measurements be the same for both? I want to sew custom dresses and want to know before I purchase this dress form.\n Answer:","completion":" The description given in the listing is very accurate. Each size is only adjustable within a specific range. I bought the large size. I am a plus size, but I just pad the areas where I need a larger size than the dress form will give me. So many people are large these days that I would opt for a large dress form, unless your clientele are very small.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size range is the medium. I just bought on and didn't catch sizes shown anywhere. When the box arrived it says it is for size 16 to 22.\n Answer:","completion":" My Medium works well for me and I usually vary in \"store\" sizes from an 8, 10 or even 12's. I'm reasonably sure16-22 wouldn't be a \"medium\"...but you never know with sizes. At 5' tall I've worn everything from a 2 (from Norstrom's) to 14\/16 (Thrift store purchases). Best way to see if it's the correct size for you would be to \"dress\" the form in one of your best fitting outfits.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the stand pretty sturdy? I need to make wings for a costume and wanted to know if more weight was applied to the back, would it become unstable?\n Answer:","completion":" Well, the base has four fairly large stabilizer bars that I think hold it really very well, the only thing that wobbles is the actual form on the pole kind of wiggles. I think if your wings are super super heavy you could always drop a couple sand bags on the legs but chances are I think you'd be fine. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could you tell me please what size the medium is? For instance my daughter wears a 11. Would this work? What size does it go up to? Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" This dress form adjusts from size 10 to 16 - so it would work for an 11 -\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm cosplaying as Nepeta and Sollux and I was wondering would I need 1,2,or 3 if I'm cosplaying as them over a 3 day period at a con?\n Answer:","completion":" If you're cosplaying them both in the same day and you wash it off, I would recommend two just in case. But if you're being (for example) nepeta for two days and sollux for one of the days, you would only need one! One thing of snazaroo can go a long way. I would suggest two because if you're painting your arms, it would be a good precautionary measure. You'd definitely have some left over, though.\n"}

If you might be sweating a bit is get the sealer but if not you should be fine\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How well does this resist rubbing off on clothes?\n Answer:","completion":" It holds up well for the first few hours however once you start to sweat it does rub off. It's not terrible, and it does wash out with soap and water but its definitely not sweat proof.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there an expiration date for the paint? Will use it for a carnival and would like to save any remainder for the next year.\n Answer:","completion":" I do not believe there is an expiration as there is nothing listed on the package.

I leave mine up since the loft area in my home is my studio where I paint and write. It's actually a beautiful piece of furniture and looks rich in any room. Plus, what I really like is the fact that you can move your canvas up or down depending on how you like to paint. I like to sit on a chair and stand when I need to paint something at the top.

Good luck.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this paint be used on rocks?\n Answer:","completion":" This is acrylic latex paint. For \"indoor rocks\" it should be fine, just clean the rocks well, and let them dry.

{"prompt":"Question: Can I use these paints on wine and champagne glasses? Do I have to bake them after to prevent it from washing off after use?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you can use these on glass, however, no regular acrylic paint will be permanent and cannot be baked on.

{"prompt":"Question: can I use these paints on a vinyl or plastic model of the hulk?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely! These are acrylic, which should paint nicely onto plastic or vinyl. You may want to apply a clear top coat to protect the finish when done and prep your piece by roughing it up slightly with some medium sandpaper, which will help the paint adhere.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the paint go on thick, or is it a bit transparent, no matter how much you put on the canvas?\n Answer:","completion":" This paint is rather thick like pudding out of the tube and it is opaque. I think it is the best value paint that I have used.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this come with a shoulder strap\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - a pretty darn cool one. It has regular handle straps (like you see in the photo). But, the cool part is, you can unsnap the handles and then snap the opposite ones together and it makes one, long, shoulder strap. I have to carry a lot of other stuff - including pushing a cart along in front of me - so this shoulder strap makes all the difference. My teaching partner had this product and when I saw how easy it was, I just had to have my own. The fabric is very sturdy. I can fit all my large easel boards in this thing - and my large easel. Soft sided but durable. Hope this helps!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this product have a window that could be used to look at prints while they are stored and protected? I want to look at my prints w\/o taking out.\n Answer:","completion":" No There is no window. It is strictly carry and or protection. It works well to carry from studio to client and preliminary appointments.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it unzip on both sides so that it can lay completely open (flat)?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. This bag is HUGE. My wife uses it and she is not tall enough to carry it by the handles without it dragging. She is 5' 6\". Just FYI\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The bottom is 2\" wide, with a gusset which allows for expansion.Does it expand to 3\", or, to a full 5 inches?\n Answer:","completion":" My best guess is that it will expand to at least 3 and up to 3 3\/4 inches.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this product soft enough for the face?\n Answer:","completion":" They are comparable to the sponges you get in the stores. They are more dense. I use them for clay work but I think they are soft enough to use. They have different sea sponges in the package. They are not all the same. I loved mine but did not use them for my face. I wish I could give you a clearer answer..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this good for the face?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello! Not sure if it is or not. I bought for a craft project. They are not soft dry.\n"}

It seems these items can be used by ANYONE who desires to (age appropriate - of course); whether professional and\/or personal\/hobby use.

I do study professional drafting\/engineering drawings as well; as I am making this a desired career path (free-lance work). And yes, I do love to draw (free-hand sketching), as a hobby.

{"prompt":"Question: ?What is the Sketch Stick used for\n Answer:","completion":" I had that question too. My art instructor states the sketch stick is a sketching pencis that has no wood; therefore, does not need any sharpening. It is a solid piece of graphite.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the quality of the pencil reliable? I hate pencils that break when sharpened or that break easily.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I believe it is reliable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would this be a good idea for a gift for a trained and experienced professional drawer?\n Answer:","completion":" I think so.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: It's too expensive.\n Answer:","completion":" the shipping cost more than the paper, so blame our great USPS!! Nice stuff though, great feedback on the product. Its just heavy, plus you have to insure it, tracking costs, home delivery costs, etc etc etc. It never ends.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How durable is it? From the photo it looks like it has lots of creases and is fairly blurry.\n Answer:","completion":" not creased, but smooth. It is blurry, in that there are no sparkles, as some of the other offerings show.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long is the roll?\n Answer:","completion":" Dear Gerald, I know its hard sometimes the way Amazon has their pages laid out, but if you scroll down the page to the product description, it states: Product Description Measures 7-1\/2 inches wide x 150 feet long for small gifts.

{"prompt":"Question: So is this for one canvas or 6 ?\n Answer:","completion":" It is a pack of 6.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has the issue of receiving only 1 canvas instead of the stated 6 been resolved ?\n Answer:","completion":" NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got 4 canvas.. TWO had punctured holes in them. I am in a care home in electric wheelchair and NO way to return them. I spent $500.00 on different things. Asked for two new ones... never got them or response. I will spread the word.

{"prompt":"Question: I am trying to put VIN numbers on my trailers will this set work on hardened steel?\n Answer:","completion":" Hardened steel (e.g. High carbon steel) that is harder than the punches' steel will not work, however trailers are usually constructed from mild steel, so these should work okay for mild steel. You should get a visible impression but don't expect the impressions to be very deep. Also, a commonly used alternative is to punch VIN into an aluminum VIN plate and attach that to the trailer with rivets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what font is it?\n Answer:","completion":" Probably closest to Arial capital letters.\n"}

I used a sloper and made it an exact body double with padding. It is stable dressform which I really like.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you stick the pins into the form?\n Answer:","completion":" Well, not actually into the form, it's hard plastic covered by a layer of fabric. You can guide pins under and out the same way you might pin a pattern to your dress fabric. I've found it more practical to cover the entire torso with a snug but stretchy sleeve. It's the easiest way to fill in the form with layers of padding or foam to reflect your exact shape, and it makes pinning easier and faster.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can I make sway back adjustments\n Answer:","completion":" You would not be able to make this adjustment just with the dress form dials.However you could possibly do this with the addition of padding such as the Fabulous Fit system.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What do you know about Dritz deluxe dress form medium\n Answer:","completion":" It works well. Must be padded to complete the sizing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone please tell me the measurement from the shoulder seam to the fullest part of the breast?\n Answer:","completion":" You adjust it to your measurement.

{"prompt":"Question: Is there a separate cover for this dress form?\n Answer:","completion":" There isn't, unfortunately. And the actual form needs a lot of reshaping.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I use this??!! The dress form is so light, it's unstable, and it's plastic so I can't put a pin into it for my life. How do you use this?\n Answer:","completion":" I, too, covered mine in a tight stretchy knit top and I pin into the shirt. As to the lightness of the form that is what I like about it; it moves easily anywhere in the room. I guess I just am used to it but when I put something on it I am careful not to tip it. I use the form for fit issues with clothing and I use it to hold long items I need to hem like a formal gown; I just take it to its tallest height. When I do this I do put the form in a wide container (like a flower pot) and stuff fabric around it so it is not so tippy while I feed the fabric into my machine. I really like this form. It is the best one I found at such a reasonable price.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the dials have the measurements on them?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, but protect your fingers, the dial knobs are sometimes hard to turn, you will probably spend time until you get the measurements right, but it works, at least for me it did\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this form work for a petite(i.e. short waisted) person?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see any specific adjustment for short or long waists. I think that the only way to get a form that really fits you perfectly is to get one of the kits that basically makes a form based on your body- sort of like paper mache'. On this form I had to put an old stuffed bra on it to get the proportions correct. I have thought of putting a spandex shift on the form and padding it to better mimic my long waisted but low busted shape. good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can someone tell me what the shoulder the apex measurements on the small dress form is?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure exactly what you mean, but from the edge of the blue felt at the neck band to the shoulder edge is 7\", the neck measures 1.5\", and from the neck to the shoulder edge is 5.5\". Hope this helps! It's a great form\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this strictly for stained glass or would it be good for straight cuts - like for picture frames?\n Answer:","completion":" Use with any type of glass\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Need to buy oil or does it come with?\n Answer:","completion":" You need to buy some.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What cuts better carbide wheel or diamond wheel for cutting stain glass\n Answer:","completion":" I really like the pistol grip glass cutter. It fits the hand and I find I have really good control when cutting stained glass. I love that the oil feeds the wheel and not messy to work with.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is it that the replacement head is roughly the same price as the complete unit?\n Answer:","completion":" The replacement head is the main component of the item, and can be used of different styles of handles.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it cut 6\/16\" thick glass tile with mesh used as back splash?\n Answer:","completion":" It will cut the glass but you will have to tap the underside with a metal tapper to break tg e glass...score the mesh with a box cutter\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I need to cut a wedge in a cover for my aquarium. The glass is a bit thicker than typical stained glass pieces (I think). Would this work?\n Answer:","completion":" According to an online glass cutting forum (name unknown), Toyo glass cutter is good for cutting thickness 3-10MM glass and mirror. I have used mine on some of the more dense opaque glasses in stained glass work with success. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you cut an arc or rounded shape?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you can - very easily. The handle moves independently from the cutting wheel. At first it will feel like you won't have any control over your direction, but you will actually have more control than a standard cutter.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use to make a fireplace for decorations, would this product hold up to make a fireplace\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}

Get more brushes after you have painted a few canvases to know what works best for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What else do I need to complete the paintings? Is there anything else I need to buy to complete the paintings?\n Answer:","completion":" You also may want a palette for mixing your paints and an easel of some sort for holding your canvas firmly, as you will use a lot of pressure\/force with this painting style.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do you cover the canvas with liquid white before painting or white gesso ?\n Answer:","completion":" Cover entire surface with liquid white first, very lightly, I emphasize lightly, then your good to paint. I have used black gesso as a background colour letting it come through the painting giving a nice effect. Difference between liquid white and gesso is the liquid white stays a liquid giving you time to paint with the gesso drying almost as soon as it's applied. Hope this helps. By the way, I love the paints, once you become comfortable it becomes a real joy to paint. Dwayne\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Although this may be unrelated to the kit, Do I need to buy canvas or can I follow Bob with A4 papers? to save money...\n Answer:","completion":" I doubt you'd get the same effects from paper because of the texture difference.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between the oil and the acrylic paints and which is best for which application.\n Answer:","completion":" The oil paints are oil based and need a thinner such as turpenoid (ordorless) or linseed oil to thin (and clean) Acrylic paints are waterbased and thin and clean up with water. The whole Bob Ross painting method is based on painting wet paint into wet paint-in other words, the wet paint does most of the blending work. Acrylic paint dries quickly and even with a retarder or additional medium to slow drying time, must be worked quickly to get the same effects. It is much harder for a beginner to use. If you want to get the same results as the Bob Ross show or the DVD, stick with the oil paints. Always use some form of ventilation when working with any oil based paints.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would it adhere to glass?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I have used it one a couple glass flower vases and it's worked quite well. Takes at least 4-6 hours to dry. I believe the directions say something about using heat or steam to make it rise more but the way you see it bubbled on the glass is how it will dry.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you unscrew the cap?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. You can close it and reuse the paint.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does it take to dry?\n Answer:","completion":" I used this to rubberize the bottoms of my young kids' socks. I try to leave it for about 48 hours, otherwise the socks start sticking to each other once they're folded together.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this safe to use on infant clothing (example: onesies)?\n Answer:","completion":" I would think so, as long as baby doesn't put it in his\/her mouth. Once it dries, turn garment inside-out and it should be safe to wash.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to make some baby booties non-skid. Wouldn't the regular puffy paint be better than this \"SLICK\" version? Also, would it stick well to fleece?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't use it on fleece, as I believe it wouldn't soak in to the fabric, and would then easily peel off in the wash (or God forbid, your child peels it off the bootie, sticks it in his\/her mouth and chokes on it!)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it make a mess? If I make a shirt with this paint would the design crack or mess up if I wash it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, they are great for clean lines the tip is very narrow so it is pretty precise. I used them to make non-slid socks for my 2 yr old twins.\n"}

As long as you let it dry completely, don't scrub it when you clean, and don't pick it off, it stays pretty nicely (though requires a SUPER steady hand!).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Also, what are the differences between this paint and acrylic paint, or are these the same?\n Answer:","completion":" Acrylic paint dries harder. The finished product is stiffer. That might work for some areas on shoes, but you really want fabric paint to decorate fabric that will be worn.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would these work to decorate College graduation caps?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely! just be sure to tap out the air bubbles before you do it, so you dont make a mess of the graduation cap. (turn the container upside-down with the lid still on and tap it on a hard surface a few times. keep it upside-down until you use it). and make sure you giveit ample time to dry in a safe place where nothing can touch it and mess it up.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use these for handprint aprons, would it be good to use for that and wash off of my kiddos hands ok? Thx!!\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, these would make for any clothing project (just line dry since the dryer will dry up the paint over time)...and it is not to hard to get off the skin-but I didn't get much on mine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I was thinking of painting Vans\/Toms any kind like those shoes. Would this be a good medium for it?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not familiar with those brands\/types of shoes. However, I dressed up a pair of plain black canvas sneakers with white daisies using this kind of paint. I believe it would work with any kind of fabric shoe. A vinyl shoe, not so sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you need to iron after paint is try to make it set?\n Answer:","completion":" We used it for crafts (on wood and plastic), but not on fabric . It worked well, and I don't think it said anything about ironing. It seemed like it would work well on fabric also.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do the other 5 glow under black light?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't tried black light, but I can say that the green and yellow work from sunshine. The blue does not seem to glow from sunshine alone.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these be used on other surfaces? Am looking for ones that can be applied to wood, canvas, paper and the likes....\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they seem to dry well on many different surfaces; glass, wood, paper.

{"prompt":"Question: I have lettering on a hoodie I would like to paint over with white or clear glow in the dark, will this harm the lettering??\n Answer:","completion":" Depends what the lettering is made out of. My guess would be no, unless you tried to peel the paint off the lettering later on. Or the paint might not adhere to the lettering and just peel right off after a little while.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this paint puff up\n Answer:","completion":" It did not puff up. It stayed the thickness that I squirted onto the material.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it really work good?\n Answer:","completion":" I use it to make window clings and reusable tattoos and for that it works wonderfully, but I've never used it on clothes, however it has always been the highest recomended by all of the crafters that I talk to.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this made in USA?\n Answer:","completion":" No, the tables are made in china.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Over all size?\n Answer:","completion":" Dimensions: 17.75\" x 33\" x 50\" Assembled. The box it arrived in was large and heavy. It goes together quick and easily. It is larger than most other play or train tables. The advantage for us was we already had lots of train stuff and just needed a table. Not much built in storage but storage boxes can be slipped in underneath.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there large lego plates that fit perfectly into this table or do i have to buy a bunch of 10x10 lego plates?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a large rectangular shaped table.

{"prompt":"Question: Is it large enough for all Thomas The train tracks and shed?\n Answer:","completion":" The table top surface is larger than the Thomas the Train table on display at our local Toys R Us....it totally depends on your train track layout, but yes, it definitely could be!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there supposed to be a sizable gap on either one side or in the middle of the table (green boards) depending how you lay the tables?\n Answer:","completion":" You could leave one of the two halves of the green tabletop off...

{"prompt":"Question: What is the height of this when assembled?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought this table for my 2 and 4 year old to play with their train station. My 4 year old is a little over 3 feet tall and this table is perfect size for her. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone use this with chairs or stools?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not - and would not think it would be practical with the height and the make up of the table - my toddle spends most of is time directly on top of it and occasionally under it :-)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone tried painting the table and if so how? Like the table but not the color.\n Answer:","completion":" have not tried to paint it however I have painted things similar.the best way is to buy a matte spray paint and spray want to paint. the matte spray paint will give it a texture that's good to paint over and then paint over that with chalk paint. there are recipes for chalk paint on Pinterest or Google pretty easy and lasting coverage.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the height of the playing surface to the top rim of the table? We may want to get a 2nd one to expand the surface.

I've seen videos of it done just not sure if this is the right one to use.\n Answer:","completion":" I have not personally attempted image tranfer onto canvas, but I do use this for all my wood transfers. I dont see why this same stuff wouldnt work. Hope I was semi helpful.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking to add some waves to my battle diorama , how is the final quality of the gel ?\n Answer:","completion":" When used alone, if the gel is too thick, it may have a yellow tinge. I absolutely love this product. I use transparent or translucent paint and paint over the gel after it's dried. You will also get great results if you add your paint to the gel itself, but i would definitely test it first.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this dry clear?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it does!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the 8 oz the Gloss Gel or Acrylic paint? I know the description says Gel but after I put it in my cart it says paint. But if I add the 16 oz to the cart then it says gel.

{"prompt":"Question: I have been interested in making clay charms, would this clay do the job?\n Answer:","completion":" Only if you want your charm to fall apart. You're much better off with the name brand clays that require baking. You can use an old toaster oven outside to bake the clay.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to make a footprint ornament from clay. Would this work for that?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't use this clay for anything. Period. I've worked with various types of clay and this is by far the worst. If you want the ornament to last without cracking, use Sculpey or Fimo. While those do need to be baked to cure, they will also last a lot longer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does it take to dry?\n Answer:","completion":" Depends on how much clay your using. I usually wait a day before I paint on it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it possible to prevent dry paper clay product not to crack or brake by acrylic or enamel paint or soak it in laquer?\n Answer:","completion":" Paint: no. Idk about soaking; I imagine it would disintegrate.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is this product ideal for making a hand impression for an 8 year old girl?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure what you consider ideal, but I think it would work much better than the kits that are sold specifically for that. I have tried those in the past and wasn't too happy with them. This is just clay so you can work with it to get the impression the way you want. Hope all that answers your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be good for mixed media art? I want to glue some clay pieces to canvas with acrylic medium and paint them. Should I use this or polymer clay?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure but would think the polymer would be a better idea. You can get it thinner, I think , than the other clay. This clay can easily crack while the polymer has some flexibility to it. Since canvas is also flexible, I'd go with the polymer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this product have Gluten in it?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know about Gluten but I do know it stains wood surfaces if left to \"air-dry\" on one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does clay shrink when it dries\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, all clay shrinks when dry because the moisture is gone and the particles move closer together. This product has some real clay in it, so it also shrinks. I would guess about 10%.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: For a Day-Timer planner with holes configured exactly as seen in the product image, will it work? Seems like many unsatisfied buyers, but all were moving the punch heads, and I shouldn't need to. Can anyone confirm?\n Answer:","completion":" Punch works well as long as you only do 1 or 2 sheets and you make sure that the sheets are all within the punch tabs. Once I got used to these two issues, the punch works fine for my Day timer.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it work with a Daytimer that has 7 holes but the middle three are closer together than the outer two on each side?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - All punches are adjustable\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this product be used with a4 sized paper (two holes 8cm apart)?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would be extremely difficult to set for a4 paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this product be used with legal size sheets?\n Answer:","completion":" It can but the tom punch will be a bit less than 11\" from the bottom of the page.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this paper suitable for making patterns for clothing?\n Answer:","completion":" Very much so. This is what I use it for. Either I copy existing patterns, either I create from scratch. This paper is nice and sturdy. One thing to note: I do not use pins, only weights when I'm cutting my fabric so it doesn't matter to me if the paper is a little thicker than usual pattern making paper. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this be used as wrapping paper?\n Answer:","completion":" It is substantially thicker than wrapping paper - but if you are willing to crease in the edges it could work. It would be like wrapping something with construction paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this paper work for wrapping gifts\n Answer:","completion":" It's see through, I've doubled in the past or done painting or drawing on the outside to create my own personal wrapping paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this paper work for a \"tracing an outline of a body\" art project?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work for blacking out windows?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, you may need to use 2 layers but it should\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this paper be used to fold paper flowers? Is it thick enough to hold its shape but be easily folded at the same time?\n Answer:","completion":" I've never made paper flowers but I would say this paper is too thick. Often when I tape a package it's so heavy the tape comes undone. I hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you tape things to this paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, tape will stick to it. I use this paper to wrap gifts. I honestly can't tell the difference between the textured sides so I've painted on both sides and taped both sides.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If you want to cover the tables for a party with this, will it show wrinkles?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it's pretty sturdy\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have a \"center\" to be put on a roll... how heavy is it??\n Answer:","completion":" It does have a center however it is very long approx 5 ft so it would likely need a custom roll. It is heavy and bulky. I leave mine in the box it came in, in the garage and lay it on a large table or the floor to wrap my items. It is somewhat see-through so I double wrap sometimes. Hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use this for table covers for child birthday party... to use with crayons. Will this definitely work well with crayons?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely!! I let my kids draw on it all the time using crayons..works great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What flavors are the different colors? Is one best for veggie tempura? (Don't eat meet...)\n Answer:","completion":" ...I think you may be mistaken. This is paint.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it washable?\n Answer:","completion":" No. At least not once it's dried on clothing. Just put a smock on the kids and a mat on the floor. You will be able to wash paintbrushes with soap and water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to start making figures. Would it stcik on them or would it fall off?\n Answer:","completion":" I personaly don't use this paint. I bought this for an elderly client that I take care of. He uses it on wooded areas, paper and canvas. If your figures are going to be wooden I say this is the product for you but if you're trying to do glass or plastic. I don't think it'll be a good Idea.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to paint in wooden surface?\n Answer:","completion":" My husband did use the paints to cover bare wood. It dries to a mat finish. We have not tested whether or not it will come off if it gets wet. My guess is that it will wash off, but likely leave the wood stained. I'm sure it would just wash right off finished\/sealed wood.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it thick enough to put a small squeeze of several colors on a paper plate for a palette for students or do you have to use cups?\n Answer:","completion":" It usually comes out of the bottle in little thick-ish globs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this like acrylic paint? Would it stick to styrofoam and not melted?\n Answer:","completion":" It's tempera. I googled your question and found this: \"Watercolor--especially the crayola watercolor in those little pans--won't stick at all. Don't use spray paint either, because it will literally 'melt' your styrofoam. Tempera will flake when dry. The best and cheapest is to use acrylic paint--the kind of craft paint that comes in little bottles.\" I hope that helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It is too think and doesn't cover well. I've added water, detergent and even thinner. What else can be done?\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't had any problems with my set of paints... I just give them a little stir. Maybe you got a bad batch?\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this on house windows to paint pictures for like Christmas?\n Answer:","completion":" Haven't tried it myself but I am told Tempura paint is the best for Window painting. Mix it with a small amount of water and dish soap to make it easier to remove.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does this take the 6000 nozzle kit? If not, which gun(s) will?\n Answer:","completion":" This gun does not take the 6000 nozzle kit. You would need the Surebonder HE-750 High Temperature Glue Gun, Amazon ASIN B0009XTPAO.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have .5 inch glue sticks will they fit in this gun?\n Answer:","completion":" Yep I believe so. I have two glue guns & the one you mentioned was my 2nd. I just used the same glue sticks from my stash. Jo\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What are the fahrenheit of the two dual temperature settings?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know, but Your question makes me curious to measure it next time I use it. At this price I would expect some variation between individual units, so I'm not sure a temperature measurement would be reliable. I have never had trouble using low temperature, multi-temp or high temp glue sticks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this work well for heating up and dispensing sealing wax?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have a switch to turn it completely on\/off or only a switch for high\/low heat?\n Answer:","completion":" It has a high \/ Low switch - but No turn off. You have to un=plug it after use... but it works great!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with the glue stand that is shown in the picture?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to buy a new glue gun. Any suggestions?\n Answer:","completion":" I bought two of these glue guns, one to use and the other as a backup. I use them daily, all day, as I craft beautiful sustainable centerpieces for weddings, favors, etc. Never once in four years have I had to open the 2nd one. Absolutely buy this one, I would not buy any other one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What color is the glue gun?\n Answer:","completion":" It is red, exactly as the picture - I have two of them - one I have used for two years about 7 hrs daily and the other one just in case the first one broke....but so far no need to use the second one. Excellent product!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be adjusted so that the six holes are evenly spaced, or must there be a larger division in the center of each set of three?\n Answer:","completion":" The six holes can be evenly spaced without extra space between the two sets of 3 holes. Also, the hole punch can be adjusted to have a larger division in the center of each set of three holes. It is a great tool to have when you have several notebooks with six holes and different spacing between the holes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it pre-set to punch holes for my new Personal size FiloFax or will I have to set it up?\n Answer:","completion":" They are not set up for the filofax - or at least mine was not. I ruined one of my home-made sheets not realizing it wasn't set properly. There were NO instructions which was annoying as I was afraid to do to much for fear of breaking it. BUT, I did slide the 2 sets of 3 punchers - each to the upper-most and lower-most part of the puncher - whereby the 2 sets are the furthest apart - and that is the setting for the filofax personal\/compact. It was easy to slide, more my fear than anything else - 10 seconds and it is done. I like the puncher and I recommend it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it work on day-timer organizers with pages that measure 3 3\/4 x 6 3\/4 ?\n Answer:","completion":" Absolutely. That's what I use. Hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Franklin Covey Pocket Planner sheets 3-1\/2\" x 6\" - two sets of 3 holes, 6 holes total - 1-1\/2\" btwn sets, 4-1\/2\" first to last hole. Will this work?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, this will work, but it has no guides for you to align the paper before punching, so you have to wing it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to adjust the slides?\n Answer:","completion":" If you pull the bottom cover (waste trap) off you will see that the two matching sets of three hole punches, which are spaced 3\/4\" apart, can be adjusted by pressing them apart or together. The positions can be either both to the inside, one on the outside and one on the inside or both on the outside of the elongate slots that control their position. This will place the two center holes either 3'4\", 1-3\/8\" or 2\" apart giving a total of three outside hole combinations of 3-5\/8\", 4-3\/8 or 5\" spacing. If you wish more combinations you must modify the part to suit. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Greetings, will this punch holes for an A5 size?\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not. It works for Personal and Pocket sizes. You could theoretically use the personal sized setting to punch one part of the 3 holes and shift your paper over and punch the 2nd part but you would already need an A5 sized page as a guide.

{"prompt":"Question: Can this hole punch be set up to punch a 5 1\/2\" page with holes at 1\/2\", 1 1\/4\", 2\", 3 1\/2\", 4 1\/4\" and 5\"? Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" The back allows you to move the holes just a tiny bit, but there is no guide or markings to set to punch for different sizes of paper. I measured the punch from end to end and it is 6 inches. So if your paper is 5.5.inches, it will fit. It seems to measure up to the measurements you listed in your question. I used a tape measure to determine.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: are the tubes 250 ml each (8.5oz) or a total of 250 ml combined?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Pumpkin Spice. I just looked at my set and each tube is marked 22 ml.

Why not, 2($29.24) =$58.48?\n Answer:","completion":" I am unsure of the pricing. It looks like Blick only carries the 1 set option.

{"prompt":"Question: watercolor look can that be achieved\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you just have to water down the paint to get the right consistency.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can I use it for T-shirt? and, is it washable?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't recommend it for a t-shirt. This type of paint is more for canvas painting.

{"prompt":"Question: is this table capable of a pure horizontal table top (flat and parallel to floor) position?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it can lay flat or it can be adjusted to several settings. Mine is tilted about 10-12 degrees up from flat. If you're looking for \"flat\" you may want to consider another table as the main reason I bought this is for the elevation from flat. The drawers are flimsy but they work for my purposes. I'm happy with the overall quality of the table for the price.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can a drafting machine be attached\n Answer:","completion":" Unsure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this adjust low enough that it would work for a 6 year old? I want to get her a art table for her bday and its either these kind or ones for toddlers.\n Answer:","completion":" The table can be assembled using either floor glides or casters. The floor glides give the lowest height: 25 1\/2\". If you need the casters, the lowest height is 27 1\/2\". Be aware that, once you choose a height, it's a non-trivial task to change it. I'm an adult, 5' 8\" tall. I set the table up with a 30 1\/2\" height. I believe my 7 year old granddaughter could easily use the table with the lowest setting. And you could always use a makeshift booster in the chair until he\/she is tall enough. Does anyone still have thick phone books...?\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will it hold a drawing board securely for works on paper?\n Answer:","completion":" I ended up not loving this board. I found that you have to really tighten it very very tight to hold anything on it and to keep it upright. I found that it would hold the board, but pressure from drawing on it sometimes caused the easel to move down.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How deep is the drawer section?\n Answer:","completion":" Drawer is 1 1\/2 inches deep.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it work with small canvases like 8x10?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it adjusts in height.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the same as the Utrecht tabletop easel?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not think so. This one w\/ one drawer is better than another one w\/ 3 drawers. I have both and they both work well, but I prefer the 1 drawer model. The 3 drawer has oil paints in one drawer and acrylic and watercolors in the 3rd.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: My son got this for me from Amazon and there are no instructions on how to set it up. I can't get it to open up to the position you see to use it\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Judith, It's easy to set up, each knob tightens or losses to allow for a wide variety of angles. I bought two different size clip boards to rest on the easel which hold paper or canvas. I absolutely love mine for the studio and plan on ordering another for home use too!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: dimensions\n Answer:","completion":" It's about 16.5\" deep, 15.5\" wide, 2.5 in high when closed, with easel up it's 17\", extends to approx. 27\"; also drops below if needed. If you use drawer, that extends out to the right up to 15\". It's a very nice piece for a tabletop. Be aware it does have a little weight if you plan to carry any distance.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: New to \"clutch\" pencils~is this supposed to be mechanical style? We can't seem to move the lead in or out without dismantling\n Answer:","completion":" You should be able to press down on the top button and hold it down. This will inturn push the prongs our from the tip of the pencil allowing the lead to slid out. From there you can adjust how much lead you want sticking out from the tip. When you release the top button, the prongs will go back to its natural position hence holding the lead in place. Hope this video helps, http:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watchv=THmIBqqn8Ss\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the length of the holder? Top to bottom, without figuring any lead.\n Answer:","completion":" About 5 and 3\/4 inches, or 144mm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you sharpen the lead? I saw a video that pulls the plunger straight out. Mine unscrews...\n Answer:","completion":" I haven't used it for some time if I remember correctly it is either by twisting the bottom and it sharpens it, or by removing the top and sharpening it that way. They also sell a special sharpener for this pencil\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do 120mm refills fit in pencil case?\n Answer:","completion":" no it takes 5.6 mm lead refills. I got mine on eBay.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would these adhere to something like plexiglass without tape or glue?\n Answer:","completion":" No, they don't stick to anything. Though they have various uses, I have them available for my dyslexic students to use.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am trying to do an oceanography lab and need to layer 8 BLUE sheets on top of each other to demonstrate how red disappears at depth- will this work?\n Answer:","completion":" I think that would work only sad fact is this pack comes with 6 of each color so you would have to cut them but I tried it with one red and the 2 blue that I had left and I could not see the red just a very dark blue.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will gold spray paint adhere to these? i want to make a wrap to imitate morroccan tea glasses\n Answer:","completion":" I have gold spray paint. Please allow me to test and I'll respond back with a reasonable answer before you go to any expense on your own.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm thinking of using this to insert into white led outdoor walkway lights to change the colors. Would this stand up to exposure to sunlight?\n Answer:","completion":" Mike, I don't believe this product would be satisfactory to your application. It is too thin and will tear easily not to mention rapid fade. It is the sort of cello product that you find wrapped around Easter baskets and gift fruit baskets that tears away easily. I think you would be better served by using colored report covers as that plastic is heavier and of a richer color. Colored transparencies are of the same quality as the report covers but the colors are a little more difficult to find.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could I print something on this? I'm afraid it my melt in my printer.\n Answer:","completion":" you cannot print on this paper, this is just a wrapping paper for some foods\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use the cellophane (for ex yellow as a circle) on faux painted walls, the glaze could be the adhesion.

{"prompt":"Question: Could I use these to make fake stained glass windows for a middle school play if I glue them to clear plexiglass?\n Answer:","completion":" I certainly dont see why not ....I would test the glue on a small spot and wait a little while to check for corrosion or color change ..but Im pretty sure you'll be ok !!!! Good idea by the way !!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can they be used to give color to uplighting without melting?\n Answer:","completion":" I've used them with CFL and LED light sources, and I haven't had a problem. The sheets are plastic, so at some temperature they will melt.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these be used for origami?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't think so. They're VERY thin, and don't strike me as something that would have folded well. They seemed like they might have been good for cutting to use in art projects, or maybe to stuff in a package like you might with tissue paper, but they were about the weight of tissue paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the people, trees and such made out of wood or plastic? Is it sturdy enough for a library-environment?\n Answer:","completion":" The trees and people are all made out of wood. I find it to be very sturdy and stable enough for my two-year-old grandson to play with his Thomas trains. I do supervise him as it is not sturdy enough to hold a toddler that likes to climb on things but for daily, regular play, it's well worth the money. The waterfall mountain is made of plastic that isn't held very sturdy in the slots, it keeps coming off. All of the little vehicles that come with it are also made of wood. The table top can be reversed for coloring, drawing, even snacking (it wipes clean with a damp cloth.) There are three bins that slide underneath that hold Jimmy's tracks, trains and other items from the Thomas collection. These could be used to store drawing supplies, Legos, figures, etc. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this compatible with Thomas trains?\n Answer:","completion":" There are many kinds of Thomas, KidKraft wood tracks are 90%compatible with \"Thomas for wood tracks\"; why 90%, because for the curved tracks I recommend buying original thomas tracks, regular, not the ones that you can adjust the curve... those adjustable ones even if they are \"thomas\" are not good either.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What are the dimensions of the table\n Answer:","completion":" Table top play area is 47 3\/4 inches by 31 5\/8 inches the table top is surrounded by half inch frame of the table. And assembled its widest points are 48 3\/4 inches by 34 1\/2 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: compatible with Imaginarium train sets?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know the answer to this. sorry\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be good to use as a lego table for older kids My 9 year old is just really into legos. Would it store a lot of legos in the bins?\n Answer:","completion":" We bought this for our 3 year old grandson who is really into Thomas Trains It was the PERFECT gift! Not really sure if I would buy this for use with legos (although at some point my grandson may use it for this). They have specifically made Lego tables that I would think might be better.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the reversed side used for?\n Answer:","completion":" My greatgrandson only uses the train scene. The other side has no motif.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this table too low to pull up a chair to sit at it? Would my toddler be able to fit his legs under to use the table to draw, etc?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, too low to sit a chair under. Perfect height to stand and play with the trains.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many pounds is it?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a one pound package. Depending on what you're casting that can be quite a lot. Assuming you're doing dental casts... You can do a couple dozen from this box. Maybe more.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am curious how much this weighs.\n Answer:","completion":" is 1 pound i hope my answer help\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I make a set of fake teeth\n Answer:","completion":" Sort of, but i would use silicone putty instead (Alumilite). Alginate is great stuff, but it just helps create a negative mold, not the final positive product. Mix some up and put your hand in it. Alginate does not \"dry\"; it \"gels\", and sets up like hard jello. It is always somewhat moist, and needs to be kept wet. It is most useful for making casts from other water-based products, like plaster of Paris, or Permastone (a much harder cement). If you want to make fake teeth, you want to cast with some plastic material, and for that a silicone mold is much better.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this clay self hardening or does it need to be fired\n Answer:","completion":" Robert this clay is self hardening and great for creating vase, coil pots and boxes. I really enjoy this brand of clay it very easy to manipulate and dry. I have been using since high school and I am in my forties. You must keep it covered when you not working with it due to drying process. You must knead before using it to avoid the cracking.Enjoy it! I do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: so this clay can be air dried? I'm sorry I am a beginner and this will be my first clay purchase\n Answer:","completion":" This clay will become 'Bone Dry' then can be fired in a kiln. The clay will be very brittle in an air dry state. Once it's fired the clay will be transformed into a hard, low-fire quartz state. Then you can apply glaze and fire again. We use this clay for wheel throwing and making ceramics.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this clay non-toxic? can be used to make, a cup, for instance?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, definitely! You only have to be worried about the glaze you use being non-toxic. Red, for example, sometimes has lead in it. So just make sure whatever glaze you use specifically says it's food safe!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the cone fire for this clay? and is it a little tannish in color, or really light grey when wet.\n Answer:","completion":" The cone is a 05 and the color when wet is med gray. but it fires to a white finish.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If you fire the clay at 500. How long would u keep it in the oven? The electric oven\n Answer:","completion":" I do not recommend firing it in an electric oven at all. It only fires to green ware when baked for short periods at low temps- 250 degrees for instance, but this clay has a lot of moisture in it, so when I attempted to actually fire it in the oven at 500 degrees it exploded. Within minutes. I mean fragments everywhere, the art piece rendered unrecognizable.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Am I understand this right? 50 lbs for $22?\n Answer:","completion":" Ginger that's correct. I have ordered several time I find it a pretty awesome deal\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you use your gas oven to fire it or does it have to be a kiln?\n Answer:","completion":" This low-fire clay must be bisque fired in a kiln to 05 which is very hot, around 1800-1900 degrees, and a gas oven will not reach those temperatures. You would then need to glaze the bisqueware and refire it in the kiln to make it waterproofed. The glaze must be a low fire glaze .\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the cone fire for this clay? and is it a little tannish in color, or really light grey when wet.\n Answer:","completion":" The clay is light grey wet and white after firing. I have been firing it at 5 and 6.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this stone clay?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: if this clay dries, can it be moistened and remolded again?\n Answer:","completion":" As it's the natural clay you can do it, but I'm not sure you can mix it well for having the same amazing consistence that You would have the first.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the stand black or chrome? Also, is the vertical part of the stand completely vertical or angled? Different photos of the product are shown.\n Answer:","completion":" The stand is black and it is perfectly vertical. I have ours mounted on a floor standing easel so I can tilt it to my specifications and the vertical adjustment on the easel allows much more vertical adjustment from the tracing table. This also means that the camara is 9 feet off the floor and you need to a ladder to change the pictures. But it works beautifully!!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How far out from the edge of the table does the projector position? When projecting on the floor does the table shadow interfere?\n Answer:","completion":" Robert, I have never used the projector to project onto the floor (just onto my work table). It looks like it would project out about 12-18\" from the edge of the table it is secured to... with the track lighting I have, there would be no shadow. Not sure how helpful this is since, again, I do not use the project in this fashion.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall can the vertical arm become?\n Answer:","completion":" The stand will raise the projector 3 feet; however, it can be clamped to a table edge and swung out to project to the floor in order to extend the reach.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this product come with the projector and the stand? Is the stand has to be clamped on the table edge? How thick the maximum table edge could use it\n Answer:","completion":" This is the stand only. The projector is sold separately. You attach the projector onto the stand and clamp the stand to a table. I think the table edge should be no more than 2 inches. This stand allows you to put your paper on the table and magnify and draw your subject in a comfortable position. The stand is very sturdy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I normally draw pen and ink on 18x24 paper. How big an image does this project to the desktop? How close will it come to filling an 18x24 space?\n Answer:","completion":" The image will fill the 18 x 24 space. You just have to get the projector far enough away and focus it properly. It just takes some fooling around with until you get it the way you want it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How doees this stand attach to the projector? I have a Super Prism with both lenses.\n Answer:","completion":" It has places on the bottom of the unit where the stand screws on.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How small can you make a picture?\n Answer:","completion":" Not exactly sure, but I think it will make it quite small. My needs were to make things larger. The glass where you place your image is only 7 inches, then you go up or down from there. Hope this helps\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: totalline humidifier filter\n Answer:","completion":" There seems to be an error here. What is the question?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you use this stand with the designer? i only need the stand and do not see it available alone here.\n Answer:","completion":" If the designer is a Prism projector, you can use it.

{"prompt":"Question: What specific weight is the paper?\n Answer:","completion":" feels like Heavy. its not printing paper so its kinda hard to tell.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it easy to scan my sketches in a scanner without tearing the pages out?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would be easy enough if you have a flatbed scanner. But, the book does not lay down completely flat.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it lay flat for sketching?\n Answer:","completion":" Well, REASONABLY flat, but it is still a bound book, so it will not behave like an 17\" x 11\" sheet of paper when open -- there is still a crease down the center at the binding and especially at the front and back, the pages will lay at different levels because they have different numbers of pages upon which they rest. The pages are attached to the binding in groups of 17\"x11\" pages folded in half, and the lining to which they are actually attached has extra material to allow the cover to lay flat while the pages themselves are turned. Hopefully, that makes sense.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there any wire or metal inside?\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't run them thru a metal detector but it looks\/feels like there is not any metal in it. If your asking if its a spiral bound book inside another no its a book bound much like any hardbound book.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can it hold acrylic paint at all?\n Answer:","completion":" Francine it is ideal for dry media, and I personally would go for thicker paper for wet'un. But I am not the type to use paint of any nature, so for me this one has proved itself.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it safe to sand resin model kits using this booth to filter resin dust?\n Answer:","completion":" Myself, I'd use a separate area to do all my sanding then use a good vacuum to clean the area up. I wouldn't want to get fine dust particles in my painting area. If you didn't get it all up then when you start spraying, the pressure from your gun may kick up dust you missed and get it all over your new paint job. A paint booth is just that. A place to spray paint and not to do any sanding.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is it noisy have small room in hall connecting to neighbour and don't want something that will disturb them\n Answer:","completion":" Personally, I don't find it to be too noisy.

But you might check with the manufacturer for the decibel rating for a less subjective appraisal.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I dont have a way to vent outside and dont have an outside heated area to use my airbrush. Any ideas??\n Answer:","completion":" If you don't have any way to vent outside like windows or something, you might be able to build a water filter to clear the exhaust. It wouldn't be too hard and would only require some engineering and pvc.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are some of the uses of a ligfht box\n Answer:","completion":" The light box allows the manual replication of art (on paper). Instead of redrawing art models, contours to the T, we can just trace them with no hassle. Great for any type of paper (no matter how thick).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this battery or electric\n Answer:","completion":" Electric.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many bulbs does it take, and is it easy to replace?\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with a life long fluorescent lamp. I have not replaces mines, because it has not blown, but as I look at mines it seem all you have to do is lift the plastic tracing board to replace the bulb or take a loose two screws on the back. I never tried to look, cause it has not blown. It is not hard to change at all as I look at it. But it states on the box it is a life long bulb. And if for some reason you need to replace it, it takes a 8 watt F8T5 Fluorescent bulb. But I really do recommend it cause it work wonders for me in my Animation class, cause with out the Artograph lighttracer I would probably have to spend the night at school using their tracing boards. It also has an area up top for you to place your pencils or pens at. Worth the money!!!!!!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is a \"popular 12 8 watt bright white bulb\". Do you mean a 12 Watt, a 128 Watt, or 12 bulbs at 8 watts?\n Answer:","completion":" It is a single bulb. Replacement lamp is listed as \"F8T5 daylight fluorescent\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I trace photographs with this? Is the light bright enough to go through photos?\n Answer:","completion":" It would depend on the weight (thickness) of your photo and what you are tracing it on to. I placed an inkjet printed photo on the light box with the photo side down. It was standard Kodak photo paper. Then I placed a piece of tracing paper over it. That worked fine. However, I don't know if the results would be the same with older photos that were produced on heavier paper, or using a thicker tracing medium such as 20 lb. bond white paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i just got my artograph but it seems the lightbulb did not work. it is never switched on, only when i press the lightbulb with my fingers it will work\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't have that problem. I think you should return it.\n"}

The light is bright enough for me and my wife to copy items pretty thick. We generally use it for copying things out of books (pictures) by hand. I would be happy to take pictures of a different angle or test something for you if needed. We have been very happy with this product.\n"}

Then paint a canvas with liquitex, slap the photo on, rub any air bubbles out, and let it dry for a day or two. Afterwards use a wet finger to rub the paper off.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: After I transfer a photo, can I use this on top as a finish or is it just for the transfer process?\n Answer:","completion":" You use it as a top coat, it dries clear and works as a seal\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used with photos printed on a ink jet printer?\n Answer:","completion":" The problem with ink jet prints is they are not waterproof, so you would need to find a way to seal the print before you used this product. I like to use hairspray or a spray sealant you can get from a local arts and crafts store. You can also try You could try a sample and see if it bleeds, but any time I have tried to put any type of glue, paste, liquid on ink jet prints the colors have run. It looks like this page has some good information: http:\/\/blog.sally-jane.com\/2011\/06\/inkjet-fixative-sprays.html. Not sure I helped much...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I would like to try transfering pictures to a tree fungus instead of wood. Would this gel work and would I have to coat it with gesso first?\n Answer:","completion":" When I transfered pictures to wood I did not use gesso first. The process of getting the paper backing off the photo takes a bit of pressure while rolling off the paper, I would be concerned that it might disturb the soft fungus. So maybe whatever process you could use to firm the fungus up might be a good idea. Hope it works!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I want to project a 5\" x 5\" image onto a 6-foot by 6-foot area. Can this projector make an image that large?\n Answer:","completion":" It would be a bit of a challenge, but it can be done. I can project an 8' wide by 6' tall image. The room would need to be quite dark with no outside light contamination. As the distance from the wall increases the image intensity and fine detail decreases.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this sold with a bulb?\n Answer:","completion":" No it doesn't.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can the image you are projecting from be larger that 5\"x5\"? ind if so, up to how much larger? Thank you~!\n Answer:","completion":" The projector base is 5x5 so no you cannot project a larger image at one time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Most of the concerns was the excessive heat from the bulb. What can be substituted to lessen heat and what wattage if led ?\n Answer:","completion":" You only have to worry about heat if you are using an incandescent bulb. Fluorescent produces some heat, but nowhere nearly enough to damage what you are enlarging. LEDs produce such little heat that it isn't a concern. You just have to find one that fits right.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I do custom painted windows on re-claimed windows, would it project an outline (enlarged) onto a window?\n Answer:","completion":" It would project it THROUGH the window unless you put some paper on the opposite side to the one you are painting. But that's a fairly easy fix, I'd think. Another alternative that I personally would find to be awesome is to get the glass sandblasted. The frosted glass would take the outline projection perfectly, and you could use that as an element in your work by leaving some of the frosted portions unpainted. It would also make it much less likely that the paint would peel later. I could understand why that wouldn't be practical for a lot of the projects you might try but sounds kinda cool right? Edit: I see Pam there beat me to the paper idea. So I'll see you paper and raise you 3020 Liquid Masking Film 32 oz here on Amazon. Paint it on the opposite side, project, trace... and then when you don't need it anymore, peel it off like cling film.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I project an image to the size of 40x40 inches onto the wall?\n Answer:","completion":" You can, but the image is so fuzzy. I returned my projector.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between this one &amp; the opaque one? Thanks in advance!\n Answer:","completion":" I think they are just using \"Opaque\" as a new way to list and market the Tracer. The one I purchased is opaque itself (non transparent). Unlike the old style overhead projectors schools used that employ a transparent sheet teachers would write on and project onto the white board this device shines a lightbulb onto your image and uses mirrors to project the image onto a vertical surface. These are fun little projectors for small projects but you are not purchasing a bright movie style projector.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the power source?\n Answer:","completion":" This question was sent to me out of context, i am not sure what it relates to.

I am in America but bulb is to find yes I have enjoyed projector very much airbrush portrait artist!!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to transfer words or graphics to a painted piece of wooden furniture?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I transfer a drawing to a canvas that I want to oil paint. I trace the pattern. Then I use Art carbon transfer paper (buy at dickblick.com (Dick Blick) or any art supply). Lay the carbon transfer paper on your surface and then the pattern on top and trace. The patter will transfer to your wood or canvas.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I want to use this product on the bottom of ceramics so that they don't scratch surfaces, will this product work that way?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know if it stay on the ceramic or stop it from scratching. Maybe try the round felt stick ones.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I paint 5232 varnish over 6132 varnish ?\n Answer:","completion":" Can't give you a definitive answer to that since I don't know what the numbers represent.

{"prompt":"Question: Can you please tell me how to use this paper to preserve fine art prints that are rolled up? Or must they be flattened and put in an art folder?\n Answer:","completion":" If the prints came rolled up, I would put sheets above and below the prints, roll them back up and store them on the tube in which they came. Just keep in mind that you will have to be very careful when you unroll them so that you do not crease them. It is preferable to store prints flat--if you have the space. If you decide to display prints that have been rolled up, you may have to place heavy objects on the prints for a few days (with the buffered paper protecting each side to flatten them).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does acid free tissue paper also mean it is sulfur free and can be used for wrapping silver?\n Answer:","completion":" Interesting question! I don't have the answer for this but you may want to research http:\/\/www.printfile.com\/Buffered%20And%20Unbuffered%20Storage%20Materials.pdf, OR contact the company directly.

{"prompt":"Question: Do they work the same as Polychromos (the non-watersoluable version) when used as a dry medium?\n Answer:","completion":" Polychromos pencils are hard, the Faber-Castell watercolor pencils are soft, softer than Prismacolor color pencils. So, none of these work the same on dry media. They will be impacted by the type of paper used. You will just have to experiment. I use all three of these as well as the Faber-Castell pastel pencils, sometimes together, sometimes separately. Just depends on the look and color blending I am trying to achieve.\n"}

I love the machine and the stitch regulator works great! the only issue I have is that the regulator wheels that attach to the sure stitch frame do not sit properly. The frame the machine sits on wabbles a bit. The company says that there is nothi g wrong and would not replace it. I have gotten used to it and my quilts come out great! I would recommend it. You may not have the trouble I did with the regulator wheels sitting on the frame.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Husqvarna Diamond. Will this work with my machine and how large a quilt can it handle?\n Answer:","completion":" I'll give you what I know. The sure stitch regulator works on most sewing machines and you will have to tell the seller which machine you have in order for them to provide the correct fittings. The regulator has only to do with the stitching, not size of quilt. If you are asking how large of quilt can be placed on a Grace Frame, it depends on the size of frame you have\/purchase. Keep in mind a quilt can be placed on a frame even if one measurement exceeds the width of the frame by attaching the shorter dimension on the frame. By doing this, the length does not matter. I hope this is helpful and strongly suggest you contact Grace Frames with any questions. They have always been very helpful and courteous when I have emailed them.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do the colors look a little different when writing on white paper?\n Answer:","completion":" I've tried it on paper gift bags and white cardstock and it looked the same once the ink dried.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these look colorful if I use them on black paper, like the one of those scrapbooks you see at weddings?\n Answer:","completion":" They are not bright like neon. They are very soft and muted colors. They are 3D pens which puff up a bit when dry.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do theese pens write on glass?\n Answer:","completion":" i wrote them on my cellphone once, it works nicely; but the ink is soft and rubbery to the touch. it could be scratched off though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how good are these pens for drawuing and animating Manga art?\n Answer:","completion":" These pens have the appearance of gouache when they dry (takes about 5 minutes to dry, but give it 10 minutes to set). They are not good for drawing fine lines, but they do have a nice even surface once they are dry which is great for filling in larger areas. They are not dark like manga, even the black dries gray. Unless you are inventing a new style of manga (which could be interesting), I would recommend sticking with Sakura's Micron pens. Micron does have brush tip pens for filling in larger areas. If you want to try manga on black paper and don't mind wider lines, these could look pretty cool. Enjoy your arting!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there any space to write anything next to photos?\n Answer:","completion":" The whole page is blank...it's one whole big page, not one that is divided with slots to place pictures in. You have to arrange the pictures the way you want to arrange them so you can control the amount of space around each picture for whether or not you want to write around them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I ordered an album for photos. I was looking for a scrap book to put invitations, programs and other memorable items. Will this do the trick?\n Answer:","completion":" Yeah this will do the trick! Each page is a full page, there aren't separate photo pockets\/sections within each page. I would call it a scrapbook rather than a photo album. I actually used it for the purpose you are looking to use it for :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the plastic pages come with the paper insert or do you have to buy that separately?\n Answer:","completion":" the album comes with the paper inside the plastic sheets\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you design different blocks into one quilt, like a sampler quilt? Or do the blocks all have to be the same?\n Answer:","completion":" The blocks do not have to be all the same. If you have a 5 X 7 quilt which is 35 blocks, then you can have 35 different blocks. Actually, it's nice to combine different blocks and see what you get. The geometry of the shapes formed is endless. I would recommend this especially for the price. I have designed several quilts already and I'm happy with the results. While EQ7 will expand the range of what you can do, with your imagination, this might be all you need.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this work on windows 8\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to do T-Shirt quilts. Will it help me arrange different size blocks?\n Answer:","completion":" No. The block size it set up initially and is for the whole quilt. I have made several tee shirt quilts. I stabilize 14\" square of the design. Then trim to 12\" square.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do i need eq7 to use this?\n Answer:","completion":" No. It's a stand alone program. It is very limited, and best for beginners. Limited in design function, you can only choose blocks already prefabricated by the program. But very helpful for figuring out yardage and whatnot.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone know where I can download the program? I do not have a cd drive. Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" Check the electric quilt website if download option is available. Have some one copy it to a thumb drive maybe can install from that drive.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this software work on a MacBook Pro?\n Answer:","completion":" As per the product description: \"Requires Windows 98\/2000\/ME\/XP\/Vista\/7.\" So unless you are running Parallels or Fusion (Windows emulation environments for Macs), no it will not work on a MacBook Pro. If you have or purchase the full-blown software from this company (Electric Quilt 7), you can purchase a \"migration kit\" that allows you to run that on a Mac. *This* product (Quilt Design Wizard) does not have that feature.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it help me enlarge and reduce block sizes? Does it calculate the seam allowances?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it will. You can design blocks on the screen in any size...it automatically prints, templates with allowance, foundation pattern if applicable, or rotary cutting instructions.

{"prompt":"Question: Does this program have the hexagon quilt template?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think so. I did not find it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Once I design the top, will the software calculate how big, or small, to cut my fabric to achieve the finished block size I want?\n Answer:","completion":" If block on the design is the size you want, yes. Under print you have the choice to print rotary cutting instructions or print templates to use in cutting the pieces of the block. I love this program.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: flash time\/ cure time\/ recoat time?\n Answer:","completion":" It all depends on the temperature of the room you are working in and the surface area you are covering. I have found that 24 hours is typically enough time before applying a second coat. For a full cure time I usually wait 3 days.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Used on bar. Mostly beautiful but a few places around the edges are tacky and now have finger prints in them. Will a second coat hide the prints?\n Answer:","completion":" A second coat should help problem. I put on one coat in two batches. On the second batch I did not stir enough and ended up with a tacky surface in a few places. Talked to company and they said to do a second coat. Put on second coat and had a good chemical reaction. No tacky areas now. I have had the product on my bar top for three years and it looks as good as the day I put it on....i.e. GREAT!! Just be sure to stir the 2 components together completely when making a batch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I used this product on a table and had two small dips would It be possible to fill just the dips and even out or pour over the entire surface?\n Answer:","completion":" Unfortunately filling only the two dips would be difficult to match the surface of the rest of the table, extra material would try to spread evenly across the table but would setup before completely smooth. Fortunately this product does stick to its self so, a thin, additional pour could give you the results you are looking for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have an old closet door that I drew and painted cartoon charaters on it.

{"prompt":"Question: Can you sand and recoat\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Used clearly on my countertop it didn't self level &amp; I have ripples now that it has dried! What can I do?\n Answer:","completion":" More than likely there was more hardener in the mix. Do another coat and right after pouring us a heat gun or hair dryer to move it around and remove bubbles and any unevenness.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the dimensions correct? What are the correct dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" I've measured mine and they are 13\" wide x 13\" deep x 9.5\" high.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Could a baby playing with the box accidentally collapse it? I'd like to store toys in the box, but would be a hassle if it's constantly collapsing\n Answer:","completion":" Probably could, but I wouldn't think it's likely. We use these for shoes in a storage shelf. So, lots of shoes stacked in. It's held up for 2 years now. Constantly daily use from currently 4, 5, and 7 year old.

It may eventually harm the box.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: this box has two different sets of dimensions. What are the correct dimensions?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, Rozann. I just measured mine and they are 13\" wide x 13\" deep x 9.5\" high. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: An Etsy seller suggests this to use as colored cardstk for stamped wedding invitations. The question about it smearing concerned me - would that work?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine only smears if I dont let it dry completely\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used on paper napkins with clear stamp?\n Answer:","completion":" with this product, I would suggest no as the ink can be 'leaky\" it's quite moist. it really needs paper in order for it not to bleed. just my thoughts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought some white pigment ink and made a card and the next day I touched it and it smudged.Why does this happen?\n Answer:","completion":" Pigment Ink does not dry on slick surfaces. It takes longer to dry on paper, making it great for heat embossing with clear EP though.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I would like use this ink to stamp my logo on kraft paper box.Do you think would it work?\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work on a printed canvas?\n Answer:","completion":" Figure you could try it on a scrap, but if it were me, I would use Stazon (hope I'm spelling this right) brand ink pads... that stuff stamps on ANYTHING!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it dry right away when you heatgun the embossing powder?\n Answer:","completion":" I have never had any problem with it drying. The issue is that you HAVE to make sure all of the embossing powder has melted when you hit it with the heat gun - and be aware that it takes the heat gun a moment or two to heat up... just because it's blowing doesn't mean it's hot enough. Once it has warmed up, and your embossing powder is on there, it should \"dry\" (harden is a better word) within 10 seconds.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this on fabric, and if so, will it be permanent?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not think so. It's just a spongy ink - that will likely be washed out in the machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there an ink pad around the size of 5x7?\n Answer:","completion":" we have primarily 2*2 1\/2\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this good to use I fabric and is it permanent ?\n Answer:","completion":" I only use it on paper. My instinct tells me it would not work on fabric since it smears even after I've let it dry overnight (and it would probably smear when washed). But maybe some one else has had success.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Want this for a finger printing project, how difficult\/easy does this ink wash off hands?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi It washes really easy and it's good in pigmentation. Good for bigginers considering money wise. Overall I recommend it. Hope it answers your question.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have a 2.5\" diameter stamp. Can I dip the whole thing and get a rainbow image? Or are there raised dividers that would interfere?\n Answer:","completion":" Graham, there are no raised dividers to compromise your image. Sometimes I put my stamp on just the blue or red quadrants to avoid rainbow effect. Wash and dry your stamps between uses so pad colors don't get mixed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the individual stamp colors removable so I don't have to get a rainbow with larger stamps?\n Answer:","completion":" yes each color slides out and has a small handle to hold on to I had an old set that I just replaced and the only difference is my old set has the color number for each color so you could buy the reinkers this set dosent have that but I copied the numbers and color names to my new set..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Anyone know if this will work on a canvas? I want to collect kids thumbprints on a canvas for an art project. Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" What a cute idea! Pigment inks transfer well to canvas and you will get the best results with 100% cotton canvas. You may have to press their little thumbs onto the surface with a little more pressure to optimize their print. Best wishes and hug them all for me!

{"prompt":"Question: How long does the ink last? Is one enough for 100 thumbprints?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not entirely certain how long one would last, because I've never had reason to give it heavy use...I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance with your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of material should I apply the ink on? Is paper or poster kind of paper good?\n Answer:","completion":" It should be fine on either, you may have to take a hair drier on low heat to it if it doesn't dry in a reasonable length of time though, or maybe emboss it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you tell me the size of each nib in milimeters? Thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" Hey there, in the kit I bought, there are a .5mm, .7mm, and a 1mm sized nib. They write rather smooth, and I am new to learning calligraphy; however, I caution you, once I put the ink cartrage into the pen and capped it when I was finished writing, the ink dried up after a few days. I have yet to figure out why, but just something to be aware of.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this suitable for a 6 year old?\n Answer:","completion":" Probably not. I didn't get started on traditional calligraphy pens until I was 8 years old. I would recommend a nice calligraphy marker set, like these, for a starter: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Staedtler-Caligraphy-Duo-Markers-3002C5\/dp\/B003MR4QE4\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1386034215&sr=8-1&keywords=calligraphy+markers, paired with a great beginners calligraphy book. If they show an aptitude for calligraphy after that, then I'd recommend this product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this product work well for left handers?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it does, as well as can be expected, considering that the manufacturing world is dominated by righties. Lefties can tilt the paper or the pen, or the hand for that matter, but the \"egg and line\" writing method, also known as \"italic,\" will work just fine for a lefty.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: This may be a stupid question, but can you dip nibs into ink for writing as well or just use the cartridges?\n Answer:","completion":" No these are not \"real nibs\". It already has the ink in it. I bought these for my kids for less mess, and more ease.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: This may seem a little silly, but I cannot seem to get the ink to flow into the nib. There are no instructions in the booklet for doing so. A little guidance please.\n Answer:","completion":" Make sure you put the ink holder in the right way...the pen has a special attachment that will break the seal to let the ink flow. If you did put it in the right way then wear your grungy clothes take the pen outside and, nib down, just shake the heck out of it. Those are the only suggestions I can give. Hope one of them works for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Maybe this seems silly, but I can't seem to get the ink to flow into the pen...and there arn't instructions for doing this. Can anyone give a little guidance please.\n Answer:","completion":" Well, I stood over something to catch the flying ink (a sink, trash can, etc.) and just shook it downward - same way you want the ink to flow - then tested it, if it didn't start to flow after a few seconds I gave it another shake. (Not up and down, just downward.) It always worked for me!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the pen that you dip in ink then write.\n Answer:","completion":" No, the kit comes with ink cartridges you put inside the pen, and then you just have to work the ink into the nib.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I ran out of the ink that came with the little cartridges. But I can't find refills. Does that mean I have to throw away the pen?

{"prompt":"Question: I need to drill very small holes (1-2mm) in crystals - Will this set do the trick?\n Answer:","completion":" I didn't know the answer to your question because I have been using them for etching and grinding metal. So, I was curious and just now took a small piece of green calcite put it in a tray of water and successfully drilled a 1.5 mm hole in it with one of the small cylinder shaped (second from left) diamond burs from this 20 piece set. It's not super fast but it definitely works. Also, I had previously used that same bur for grinding a steel washer. The only problem is, now my daughter wants me to make her a set of green calcite earrings. Hope that helps! George in NJ\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these work with the dremel tool?\n Answer:","completion":" I have 30 years experience as a auto restorator and the answer to your question is: YES, the pro-quality 20 piece diamond bur bits does work with the dremel tool because that is what I use all the time and it works great.

{"prompt":"Question: I can use this to cut a hole in a glass vase? A pretty good size hole, as it will be used to hang with an Air Plant in it. Thnks.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you can but be sure to run water on the area because a lot of heat will be generated and the heat can loosen the diamond grit quickly. Also, you should back up the area where you are drilling to minimize cracking. I put masking tape there too to help minimize cracks. And do NOT force the drill. Let it move forward slowly but at a high rpm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these recommended bits fit the Wen flex shaft?\n Answer:","completion":" They are standard. Or you can use an adjustable chuck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Which Rotary tool does this set work with?\n Answer:","completion":" I used an adjustable chuck with my dremel, part no. 4486 I think, that also works with my Black and Decker. I recommend you purchase an adjustable chuck, and you can fit practically any other bit into your rotary tool.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What speed should I use these tools to cut gemstones: high speed or low speed? I use Dremel 4000.\n Answer:","completion":" Judging from my experience with these items, I would suggest you try it at slower speeds and work up till you have acheived a speed that works best on the material you are working with. Be careful not to let the bit get to hot. Running at a very high speed seems to ruin the cutting edge of the bit. I think the speed will vary according to the hardness of the material you are working with. Do not be afraid to use a little water with the bit either. It is very important not to overheat the bit. I hope this answer is of some help to you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these work with a Foredom flex shaft?\n Answer:","completion":" I use them with my detailing rotary tool and my Dremel flex shaft when carving wood. They work just fine.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are these refillable as the other Copic markers are?\n Answer:","completion":" No, these ones are not, BUT I used mine for a very long time (four to five years) before I had to replace then. If you want the refillable ones, you're looking for the MultilinerSP series they are quite a bit more expensive, but there are exchangeable nib sizes (not included) available and after all, they ink is refillable. The SP come in sets of four, or a set of ten. You can get exact specs from copicmarker.com on what sets are what. Hope that helps.\n"}

I've been using those but my copic markers are causing the lines to bleed when I go over them with color.\n Answer:","completion":" I get the frustration of putting time and effort on something only to have it be ruined.When I bought the pigma microns I thought they would work with alcohol markers like copics but they would bleed no matter how long I let them dry and ruin my drawings. Pigma microns weren't made for alcohol based markers at all,while the multiliners were specifically made for copic markers which are alcohol based.

The colors are defined by the number on the end of the cap.. i.e., R29 is a (R)ed shade where the 2 and the 9 define the different aspects of that shade of red. R27 is very similar to R29, but is lighter in color where as R59 is very different; more of a maroon shade.\n"}

This will be to the molecular ink paraphrase. Since the color will be the color fiber and dye of paper and molecular bond, we do not become a so color ride on top of the material to be drawn as pigment. Therefore, plastic, since dye component will be only attached temporarily on the surface of ABS resin or the like, it will take it and wipe. Some people it is to use your Copic for some model but, in that case, basically established spray we have become essential. Before you paint, you have established over many layers only after you have painted. Therefore, we recommend that made using the exclusive paint so long that the paint.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how does this compare to private reserve ink?\n Answer:","completion":" I like Noodler's, even though it doesn't \"cure\" as fast as the Fast Dry Private Reserve. I can reactivate Noodler's with a light wash and watercolor brush for a time after laying down line work. Even though it may seem dry to the touch, Noodler's can still smudge for a while. This is great if, like me, you wish to use it for quick ink washes. Not so great if you want to lay in clean color during the same sketching session, or if you want to use it for lettering and have a tendency to work with the side of your palm touching the paper. (I would imagine this would be particularly so with southpaws who must work from left to right over their freshly inked lines.) I use Noodler's in a couple of vintage fountain pens and have no problems whatsoever; it is the only ink I'm currently using in my Lamy medium nib pens.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this ink work for writing on glass?\n Answer:","completion":" Noodler's inks are engineered for writing on paper. Ingredients in their water resistant, and especially their \"Bulletproof\", inks chemically bond with ingredients found in most paper. Thus the the mark becomes a permanent part of the paper. The liquid base ((primarily water) of Noodler's inks deposited on materials like glass, metal, or polymer (plastic) surfaces will evaporate leaving the various coloring agents and chemicals (salts) on the surface. However the deposit is not likely to be durable for most of their products. Even dried \"Bulletproof\" Noodler's inks can be washed off of such surfaces with water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hello, I must have an ink, which is waterproof, does not bleed\/smear on writings where there is a splash of water\/snow-flake. Black, &amp; show\/navy blue.\n Answer:","completion":" It is not waterproof.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I received this ink and it seems like more of a light brown than a black. Does this match with others' experience? I was expecting something darker.\n Answer:","completion":" I assume because it's fast-drying and meant for thin papers it's not the \"blackest of the black\", not like the black of the ink bottle. Mine was certainly NOT a light brown or anything close to that. It's a dull black for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this ink work well in regular fountain pens. I asked Pilot directly if they sold waterproof inks for my Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen. They answered that they do not, and they recommend against using waterproof inks in fountain pens because they...\n Answer:","completion":" Noodlers is fountain pen ink, but so far, I've only tried one called bullet proof. I have it in 3 of my pens and have not had a problem. However, if you have very expensive pens, be sure to verify this for yourself in a cheaper pen. I have some terrific pens from China called the Hero - 8 horses and it was only about $7.00 free shipping. Anyway, Goulet Pens.com or something like that has everything you'd ever want to know about pens and inks if you are still in doubt. As far as the waterproof. I have to let my drawings dry really well before applying color because it does bleed. Sometimes for me, that's good because I also do ink washes and apply water on a brush right away to get that bleed. A lot of artists are recommending Noodlers Lexington Gray ink. I hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what is the best paper to use?\n Answer:","completion":" Entirely my opinion from testing and experience, I like paper with some weight to it such as Bristol,vellum Bristol, watercolor, or for mix media or dry medium. But try any paper your curious to try it on, it might be different for you. How you blend\/use the markers is a definite factor. For example, I can use high quality paper but if I don't understand how to blend\/use the markers, it'll still come out bad. Hope that helps!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this FDA approved for cooking processes with food?\n Answer:","completion":" While I cannot say yes or no. I am going to go with no. I imagine it would catch on fire, if you expose it to heat for a period of time. It is just paper. Like construction paper on a roll. I suppose you could wrap food with it, but I don't think you would want to. It doesn't seem that dust free. All you have to do is smell it or handle it.

{"prompt":"Question: is the puncher ajustable\n Answer:","completion":" No, this is not adjustable. The holes are positioned for standard 3-hole paper. It is the favorite hole punch I have ever used (except for commercial hole drillers) and is amazingly sturdy and easy to clean.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size paper holes does it make\n Answer:","completion":" It make the same size hole as pre-punched paper. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it hold a canvas 31\" tall? It's wider than that, but I can always use two easels to accomodate for the width.\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure. From the bottom to the top of the support arms it measures 21\". A 31\" tall canvas would stick out a good 10\" from the tips of the arms.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this hold 22\"x15\" corkboard with Jewelry displayed on it; I use wooden easels, but are to heavy.\n Answer:","completion":" I used this easel to hold a 22\" x 18\" wood frame that is about 1\" thick for display in our trade booth. It is pretty sturdy and am very pleased with it. Very light weight and fold down very small and compact.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: wil this work for canvases that are 16\"x20\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Yeah, that should be fine. I used it for a few prints that were 24x30. As long as your canvas isn't too top heavy, it shouldn't be an issue.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the dimensions when this is folded for packing?\n Answer:","completion":" roughly 5x3x17\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it hold a heavy clock?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe it will. It seems very sturdy when I use it for painting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: From the description, the back leg allows for an adjustment of the easel's angle. What is the most \"declined\" angle, or \"shallow\" tilt?\n Answer:","completion":" The easel will only tilt back to about 30 degrees\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: weight?\n Answer:","completion":" Very light yet sturdy easy to carry I've bought 5 most of my art group now have them\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it hold a 24\"x36\" if I place it horizontally?\n Answer:","completion":" I agree with cjs here. These will hold my 18x24\" foam boards and are stable if you don't touch the foam boards. Really for displaying only.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall is this?\n Answer:","completion":" The height from base to center joint is 15\" the two arms measure 8\" each. They swivel up and down.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would these easels be sturdy enough for children to use in art class?\n Answer:","completion":" These easels are quite sturdy, and as long as the children are using them for drawing or painting boards, I think they should hold up nicely.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: approximately how many beads are in the package?\n Answer:","completion":" From what I have googled...approx. 1900.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these beads good for baking crafts?\n Answer:","completion":" No these are not these are meant for string crafts. Baking crafts are perler beads.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it fit in the pipe cleaner?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I use these beads for a project in my classroom for that exact purpose.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: WILL THEY GO ON A 5 MM DIAMETER CORD??\n Answer:","completion":" Probably not. The holes are only about 3.75 - 4 mm wide.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these be used with beading loom?\n Answer:","completion":" I can't say for sure since I have never used a beading loom, but the hole is quite large and beads not easily breakable, so I would guess you could. Great colors!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: about how many beads does it come with?\n Answer:","completion":" Too many to count. It took me about two hours to sort the colors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Approximately how many beads are in a 1lb bag? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" About 3000\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size is the actual cut-out ? Will it nest with the x-large oval ?\n Answer:","completion":" How wide and long is the oval? I would estimate the heart cutout is a inch high and wide.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the actual dimensions of the cut-out oval - large squeeze punch?\n Answer:","completion":" 3 and half cm.X2 cm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will these cut aluminum cans?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think so. I haven't tried that. The clearance where the blade edges meet is big enough for paper but I don't think aluminum can would fit.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I wanted to know the actual size of the oval cut-outs, width &amp; height? I wanted to know if the actual cut-out of the heart was 2 inches?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not have the heart, call the company? Sorry!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I wanted to know the actual size of the oval cut-outs, width &amp; height? I wanted to know if the actual cut-out of the heart was 2 inches?\n Answer:","completion":" I have only purchased the circles and they cut exactly the size stated in diameter (across).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can someone please tell me what size is the circle cut? medium doesn't tell me anything. i'm searching for 3\/4 inch. thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" \"Medium\" isn't really very helpful is it? I measured it at 1\". This one looks like a better punch to me, and it's marked with the exact size: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/EK-Tools-Circle-Punch-0-75-Inch\/dp\/B0090JVBP0\/ref=dp_ob_title_def\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are you able to place this a few inches into a piece of paper or photo or do have to punch right at the edge of the paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Mostly it has to be near the edge of the paper. You can get creative and fold paper a certain way to get a punch where you want it. You can wrinkle paper a bit to get the punch a few inches in.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it cut well with sticker paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it will, at least one layer. I would punch a couple of hexes from plain paper afterward to clear any adhesive from the device.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can someone please tell me what size is the circle cut? medium doesn't tell me anything. i'm searching for 3\/4 inch. thank you!\n Answer:","completion":" The product description is sort of hidden under all those pictures. Hard to find, but it says \"This classic punch creates a 1\" circle.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What about photo prints, will it cut those?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Debra: I have used this tool to cut out graphics printed on matte photo paper and it does just fine. No worries.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many sheets will it punch at once\n Answer:","completion":" Returned them, not as good as the EZ brand ... but we punch card stock and only one at the time. Good Luck\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: looking to punch some 2mm cardboard, can this do it?\n Answer:","completion":" No, I'm afraid it's not powerful enough for that. Regular paper, maybe light cardstock is all it can do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this punch cut 200 mesh wire filter material?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure--the wire might \"bend\" as it's cutting. It doesn't do well on thin plastic,\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what size is the circle? even a zoom view of the package gives no clues! but we know its good for arthritic people.\n Answer:","completion":" The size is 2 inches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it cut through lamination? Like a laminated paper?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. These are strong, that and card stock!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the dsitance from the edge of paper?\n Answer:","completion":" The furthest distance is approximately 2mm. The bottom cutting edge of the circle, closest to the handles is what determines this. You need to cut your circle close to a cut edge.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking to make vinyl polka dots for a wall, will this cut through the adhesive backed vinyl? Would the EK Tools punch be better?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would punch through just fine. Mine works great on heavy cardstock, so I think it would be fine with the vinyl. The design of these punches makes them very easy to use, so your hand doesn't get as tired punching multiple times.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there one that punches out 4 in circles?\n Answer:","completion":" No. You should look at the Fiskars Circle Cutter, which cuts 1-8 inch circles, and you set the size.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, will it cut through fabric, if no, do you have any suggestions. Thanks A Bunch Nina\n Answer:","completion":" No this cutter is NOT for fabric. Only paper and lightweight cardstock, about as thick as the reply cards in magazines. If you want to cut fabric with great precision, use the cutter to make hexagons out of freezer paper, then iron the freezer paper to the fabric (shiny side down, using a hot iron). Then it will become a template to cut out a hexagon using the edges of the paper as a guide. Peel off the paper as gently as possible. If you use starch or Magic Sizing to press the fabric first, the weave of the fabric will be more stable for the part where you must pull off the paper. Also, look into English paper piecing techniques, where you wrap the fabric around a cardstock hexagon and join them together with whip stitches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I bought the 2in round and round and can't seem to get it to work! I have used regular computer paper and 65 lb card stock. Neither will cut at all.\n Answer:","completion":" It must not be functioning properly. It works real easy on both paper & card stock and construction paper as well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone tried this with felt?\n Answer:","completion":" no, not on felt. using to cut soda pop cans. works like a charm!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this cut cardboard? If so how thick?\n Answer:","completion":" I use mine to cut card stock (for quilting templates). The thickest I have tried is about 65 lbs (thickness). I haven't tried it with cardboard (as in a traditional cardboard box material).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this come with various sizes? is it only an oval shape like in the video?\n Answer:","completion":" There are 3 sizes, Medium, Large and Extra Large, and lots of shapes. You can search heart, daisy, stamp, cupcake, cloud, circle, block, etc. Joni\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size does it cut. I want 2\".\n Answer:","completion":" The large punch is 1.5\" and the only two I got were this one and a smaller one. Call the company? Why don't they say?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you clean out the confettie\n Answer:","completion":" John, that is the trick - it makes a large piece of round confetti that pops out. Any residue paper can be wiped out with a finger.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this cut through plastic?\n Answer:","completion":" no!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone tried to use this on craft foam?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't suggest it. In my experience, that punch doesn't even work with craft paper!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How far into the page does this punch reach?\n Answer:","completion":" I returned 2 of these so I don't have them anymore. The reach was short (less than 1\/2\") and similar to the reach of standard push-style punches. Also, I needed a deeper reach, so I tried folding the paper and using this punch to cut a half-circle thru two layers of paper--however, the punch is not very strong, so two layers of standard paper may break the punch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this cut wool blend felt approx. 2mm thick?\n Answer:","completion":" Don't think so. It couldn't even cut through 2 wax papers together.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how large are the circles?\n Answer:","completion":" Plastic. They broke after one punch. I wasted my money.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it hold any size bit?\n Answer:","completion":" I have checked on the Fiskars website and here is what I found: The perfect craft tool for making books, jewelry or altered art, this set includes four standard drill bit sizes. Our Craft Hand Drill makes it easy to add holes to a variety of materials when creating unique works of art. The easy-to-turn hand crank eliminates the need for batteries and cords while providing smooth, consistent operation.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this drill work drill nails with plastic anchors into a wooden wall? Will this drill work drill nails with plastic anchors into a wooden wall?\n Answer:","completion":" You'll need additional bits, but it accommodates standard 3\/8\" bits. The included 1\/8\", 3\/16\", 5\/32\" and 3\/32\" bits will make holes for wood screws in sizes #2-#5 WITHOUT anchors, probably just #2-#3 with anchors. All wood isn't the same. You can drill newer fir and pine with no problem. It would be tougher in some cherry, teak, mahogany, hickory, pecan etc., ESPECIALLY the Latin American versions where it may be coming from old growth forests. I had to drill a 3\/8\" hole in a 112 year old 1\" thick shelf, no idea what type of wood it was. With a corded, electric drill I had to do it over 3 intervals separated by cool-down breaks when the smell of burning wood and rubber became too strong because old, natural wood was that much stronger than cheap, weak farmed lumber today. Keep in mind that the larger hole you drill, the more effort will be required.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does cut through glass?\n Answer:","completion":" I have only used it to cut through wood and metal. You might need a special glass cutter because glass can crack easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size holes does it drill?\n Answer:","completion":" You need to insert your own bits. So the size hole would be determined by the size you selected.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this work with Dremel bits?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes - dremel bits fit into it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this drill be used with Black &amp; Decker 15557 Drill Bit 10-Piece Set? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Hello, We have checked with the manufacturer and this can only be used with the drill bits that come with the hand drill. Thanks\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it easy to make precisely located holes with drill? Is it easy to see where your drill will pierce the item when actually turning the handle?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it is pretty precise. You just have to be careful about the material you are drilling. For instance, when drilling into a shell, the drill can slide from your intended spot, or it can crack the shell\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the shank 1\/8\"?\n Answer:","completion":" I dont really know but it will hold all kinds of bit's it ajusts just like a real drill. This thing is so cool I use it all the time. This puppy will drill threw pretty much anything. I'm a crafter Domino's, jewelry, Steal, plastic, sea shells, Buttons, You have allot more control over it. Good luck. And buy it you'll be glad you did.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this drill work for going through other metals such as copper, steel, or brass?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say it depends on how thick the metal is. I have a vise which helps hold the piece in place as I press the drill down while turning the handle. My answer is, yes, I think the drill will cut through thin sheets of metal. I think it would also depend on how sharp your drill bit is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of batteries does it require?\n Answer:","completion":" No batteries needed. You turn the crank handle and it drills. It is so you can drill small holes slowly through delicate materials.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between \"Twin-Fit\", \"Double Deluxe\" and \"Double Full Figure\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Here is a comparison chart that I found very helpful in selection of a dress form: http:\/\/www.joann.com\/static\/project\/0812\/P389799_select_the_right_dressform.pdf\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How large in woman's dress size does this go?\n Answer:","completion":" According to my form and McCall\/Butterick patterns it goes up to about a size 28. Pattern sizes are not the same as store-bought clothing sizes though. Max. inches are about 54\"x47\"x57\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the form's height adjustable? I'm making floor length attire, like cloaks and dressed and such, so I need one that has adjustable height.\n Answer:","completion":" My dress form is set for for me and I am 5' 9\" tall. I only use it for me, so I am not changing the settings. I am pleased with it and wish I had purchased one years ago.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the tallest hight the form can be adjusted to? I'm 6'2\" tall.\n Answer:","completion":" The pole\/pipe\/stand ends at a measure of 65\" and the sets down into the pipe. If more height was needed it would be rather simple to add an additional pipe and clamp from the hardware store\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the old dress forms made it possible to pin the fabric onto it.... does t his come the same way? i would like the cotton form that allows me to pin\n Answer:","completion":" Its not cotton, but you can pin to it.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How adjustable is the LENGTH of the torso? Is this only for \"normal\" (short) people? I'm 5'10\". Most dummies are REALLY short.\n Answer:","completion":" I have two, a regular size and a +size and do not see that either has an adjustment for the length...shoulder to waist or waist to hips. Maybe some of the pricier models would have that feature. Hope so as they are really very nice to use with fittings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What US size ranges does the full-figure cover? I can't measure my friend since it's a surprise gift. She's a 16-18\n Answer:","completion":" That would be the smallest selection on the full-figure form.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Excuse me, How many pegs does it have? I'll appreciate you'r answer, Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Hello. I have this loom and I can tell you that it is much larger than I thought it was when I ordered it, having 128 pegs with an extension with 40 more pegs. It is great for larger projects. Sincerely, Kelsang Pelkyong\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this product compare with the KB all in one loom? Is it easier to work with the plastic pins on the KB all in one or the metal pins on this?\n Answer:","completion":" That's a hard one because they are both wonderful products! The plastic pegs are easier to work with over all. I think the basic knit that comes off the 28 inch knitting board is better for panels. The all in one I think would be easier for garments or three dementional objects like little stuffed animals. Also for beginners the all in one might be easier to learn off of. With the metal pegs they are very close together and you could easily miss winding the yarn around for your pattern. I have both boards and like both but I lean towards the 28 inch knitting board. I hope this helps. Enjoy creating!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How faster it is the loom compared to the needles? I would like to make a blanket and before always used needles\n Answer:","completion":" It depends a lot on how much time you have to work on it of course, and how large the item you are making is, but for me it's pretty fast. I always had trouble using the needles, so I would quit quite often, with the loom it;s very easy to just add a row real quick, or sit down with it for a couple of hours. I enjoy mine much more than I did using needles.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How wide of a blanket will this loom make?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello: Pls Check out the actual Authentic Knitting Board website for more information and selections of many boards ( including another 28\" board. http:\/\/www.knittingboard.com\/Knitting_Boards_s\/1.htm The following info is from their site. Each board has 84 pins for 84 double stitches. You can use them all or just a few depending on your project. The maximum knitting width of this board is aprox 30\"-45\" depending on the yarn and spacersbeing used. (I have 4 of their looms that I enjoy using! happy looming! )\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this easy for a beginner to use? I just learned the basics of knitting, so I need to know if this is something I can learn easily. Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it is easy! In fact, I don't know how to knit traditionally! This size is cumbersome and you'll want to try it at a table. I knit with this in a rocking chair and I can rest it comfortably on the arms of the chair! Also, I recommend that you don't use the full length of pegs your first time out. If they are packaged the same way mine was the instruction were wonderful. If they seem confusing try fing videos on-line! Good luck, it's a wonderful product!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can a double bed size afghan be made on this\n Answer:","completion":" Yes but you make panels and then connect them -- if you don't have a pattern on how to join them their website does\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how small or how big knit can make this machine? What size needles holding this knitting board?\n Answer:","completion":" Last question first. The \"needles\" are actually nails. I use a crochet hook to loop yarn over. If you use a thin yarn the fabric will be loose and stretchy and wider because of the stretch, up to 36 inches. A thick yarn will make a thick tight fabric around 30 inches in width. To knit the nails are wrapped with yarn then wrapped again. Bottom thread is pulled up over the the top thread. If you have ever \"spool knit\" using a spool with four nails and pulling the rope through the hole of the needle this will be a breeze because it is exactly the same thing on a large scale. You can make this as small as the four nails like on a spool and just use four nails on the knitting board or as wide as the board. Just depends on how many nails you use. You can make the fabric as long or as short as you want just keep knitting for the length. It is very easy. The board makes a double knit fabric. I hope this has helped you a bit. If you have any other questions I'll be happy to try and answer them. Ginny\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this loom work with bulky or extra-bulky yarns (i.e. #6)? Do any adjustments need to be done for bulkier yarns?\n Answer:","completion":" I have currently made only the two afghans which were the same pattern. In that particular pattern the yarn was Lion Brand Homespun and I think it was a #5. There was no problem and again that was the particular brand and number called for in the pattern.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the two 2 How-To DVDs come with this item?\n Answer:","completion":" There was a booklet but no DVD. The company website has videos that are very helpful.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: dose this come with instructions?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes but they are the very basic ones. If u go to their website u can find far more techniques as well. I also recommend any book by \"I Phelps\" esp her Loom Knitting Primer as it has VERY detailed directions for all loom types but it's awesome for learning various stitches. Youtube is another good resource and if u search that author, you'll find her website which has quite a few free patterns as well. I don't remember if the Cd I have came with this or my sock loom by same. Company but u can find same info in Youtube by them. Personally think the All-in-One is really great because of how adjustable it is--basically making it easier to do many things including socks but this is nice due to length. Not too long or short so if u want to make clothing or small items u can--i bought since HAD original sock loom. Still find the AIO bit better somehow. Hope this helps :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the interior size of these bags? Size below the zipper?\n Answer:","completion":" It's six inches from the bottom of the ziplock to the bottom of the bag.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: PRODUCT Detail says 100 PACK of 4 by 6 for $3.67, BUT THEN says 10 PC @ .37 ea?? ALL Other sizes are WAY MORE Than $3.67. I NEED 100 Pc. CONFUSED\n Answer:","completion":" The package I received did have 100 bags, but beware that the bags are only 1 mil, not 2 mils as advertised.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would these bags be able to accommodate a stack of ten 4x6 postcards?\n Answer:","completion":" It really depends on the thickness of the card stock you are using. If it is extra thick, it may be a little snug, but if it \"regular\" postcard thickness you should be able to fit 10 cards in the bag with no problems. I use them for both business cards, ad post cards and the customer's order and everything fits quite nicely.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the zip on the narrow or wide side?\n Answer:","completion":" narrow\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this bag be heated sealed\n Answer:","completion":" Very doubtful. The bag seems to be made of the same material as a Zip-Loc bag and I'm reasonably certain it would melt if heat were applied to it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these polypropylene or polyethylene?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Bill, I wish I could help you, but I really don't know the difference between the two. Sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you measure a lobster claw clasp?\n Answer:","completion":" The length is 10mm and the width is 6mm, if you use to inches it is less than a half of inch long and a little less than a quarter of an inch wide. I have 6-10 and they are small clasp, what you would use with small chains or bracelets.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this 100 pieces cost or each piece?\n Answer:","completion":" This is for all 100 pieces.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size are the holes for connecting to the jewelry?\n Answer:","completion":" 2mm you can use standard 20 guage wire or just standard rings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these shiny or dull\n Answer:","completion":" They're shiny\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you tell me if these are nickel free?\n Answer:","completion":" The description says they are. I am no expert, so I can only go by the info posted by the seller. They are good sturdy clasps. And they are plated.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these nickel free? And what is the base metal?\n Answer:","completion":" They are silver plated.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these have lead?\n Answer:","completion":" I've scratched the plating off of one, and it looks like brass. I don't think there is any lead in these, just brass.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the stones identical or different? If different, how can I tell which stone will work for which metal(s)?\n Answer:","completion":" One stone for all...different acids for each that is all...just wipe off once tested...and good to go...all stones same just need different acids...cheaper ones are fine..no need for big fancy one...I use one stone to test all...just different acids..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there any special handling\/storage needs for these stones?\n Answer:","completion":" No. I just left it in the wooden box it came in then used it as needed. I did find the best way to clean them is pour the strongest acid you have, put it on the left over scratch marks and let it eat up the other carats that were left on the stone.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it damage the item you're testing (through scratching the surface)?\n Answer:","completion":" you are scoring the stone with the rub , so pick a spot that is less revealing and stay away from etching or engravings , I have used both stones and are equally smooth abrasion surface and last a while ...a good purchase . either one\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the dimension of each testing block?\n Answer:","completion":" 1.5 inch buy 2 inch\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are instructions included?\n Answer:","completion":" Just on the stone somewhat but not really. You pretty much need to know already. Sorry,I'm not much help. Nice stones though as they have a rubber on the bottom and they don't move all over like the others that don't have rubber. There's not much to know on these. Just scratch your piece and put solution on. Now your solution will usually tell you with their directions on how to use the stone and solution..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the dimensions dont make sense-4\" wide is not enough to work a design-are you sure the dimensions are right\n Answer:","completion":" Not actually sure why it says that in the dimensions at the top. Perhaps it's referring to shipping package size. If you read the product description lower down it says \"This Frank A. Edmunds Scroll Frame Set combines (2) 6\" and 9\" spreader rails with a set of 12\", 18\", and 24\" split rail dowels to make just about every size Scroll Frame a stitcher would need.\" This is true. The idea is not to work on the whole design all at once, but rather in sections. Do a 6\" bit, roll the stitched fabric up. Do the next section, roll up. Rinse. Repeat.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this frame work for needlepoint? I'm one of those needle people who have to turn the work upside down to stitch in the opposite direction.\n Answer:","completion":" This should work for you. I've used these for lots of cross stitching projects, and I love the portability of the frames.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this for quilting.\n Answer:","completion":" The frame comes with detachable adaptors that can accommodate hoops and scroll frames that don't have holes drilled in them but you would not be able to use too large of a hoop.

{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this for tambour beading and this Weight\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Monica, This frame is for holding material from the top to the bottom not to hold anything on the sides. It could hold sting if you wrapped it around the slots on top and as you worked down you could roll your beaded part up to give more room but only to work vertically, not circular or horizontally outward from the edge of the frame. You could work pieces of the length though and attach the sides of the worked pieces together. It could look like a solid piece if you measured it just right. If you use an elastic type of stringing thread it will be able to adjust to the curves of the drum. It could be done but I think a round size hoop would be easier. I hope this will help.\n"}

Plus, go to the company's website and look for information on their return\/replace policies - I'd be willing to bet that they have everything covered as all of the crafting items that we cart around with us are quite heavy!

The label on the can gives all kinds of warnings about flammability during use but mentions nothing about after it cures so, I called the 1-800 number for more info. Angela, in the technical department says that after the product has cured, it's fine. Give it at least 24 hours to cure. If you're really concerned give it 2 to 3 days. Once the product has cured, all flammable contents have flashed off and will not ignite. I had asked specifically about using a 60 watt light bulb (incandescent) in this instance. It should be just fine. Go ahead and make your lamp shade.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Compared to the colorsoft and the watercolor pencils, how are they? I own a set of the watercolor pencils and LOVE them...\n Answer:","completion":" The major difference between this particular set and the watercolor pencils is that the colors are much more intense. Otherwise they work similarly to the watercolor pencils. The manufacturer claims that the colors are actually inks and that they are permanent when completely dry. Watercolor pencils can generally be worked again after they are dry. I think these pencils would complement rather than replace the watercolor pencils. I suggest that you get this set and try them as I think you will enjoy working with them.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Compared to the colorsoft and the watercolor pencils, how are they?

You should paint all of them out on a grid, because they look a lot different on paper and it is a good reference to use when painting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you refill the blocks?\n Answer:","completion":" You can buy replacement half pans of the missing color, or you could buy that same color in tube form and make your own cake watercolors. To do this put the color in the empty pan and let it dry out. To use just add water and paint. Everytime the color runs out you can add more from the tube. If you paint a lot this may be more cost friendly. Tube watercolors are also easier on your brushes. Personally, I prefer the tube version as I find the watercolors stronger in pigment, more concentrated than the pan versions. I need to use less of it to get strong solutions versus the pans. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The title of the item says \"24\" colors BUT the description says \"12\" colors. Does it come with 12 or 24 colors? Are there 2 tubes of each color?\n Answer:","completion":" The description is totally off here. This is a set of 24 pan (solid blocks) watercolors - not tubes.

{"prompt":"Question: Do you know if the caddies that fit 4 pans are available anywhere separately? I have the case, but I don't have the caddies.\n Answer:","completion":" I have looked for them but can't find them anywhere.

{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this brand on glued (not set) diamonds? I used another brand and lost 4 diamonds out of my ring! :(\n Answer:","completion":" I really would not know...I personally would not use a Ultrasonic cleaning machine for anything glued...i recommend asking the manufacturer...Sorry\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this remove tarnish from silver jewelry?\n Answer:","completion":" In my opinion, I do not believe it is strong enough to much remove tarnish off of silver. In using with an ultrasonic cleaning machine, I would also recommend checking with that company's ability to use a specific silver cleaning solution that is safe for the machine. This Hagerty product is meant to help clean off skin oils and other grime from waterproof watches, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc. It is kind of effective with brass or copper tarnish, but not fully as one would expect, so that's where in the future I'd go with specific chemical liquid cleaners safe for silver, etc. The fact is, I've even read that if one does not have ultrasonic cleaning solutions like Hagerty, then to simply use dishwashing liquid mixed in water...and that surely won't remove tarnish.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this to hide scratches on a black gloss piano?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not sure what finnish you have or how glossy you want it. Not a very glossy black and will not fill if it was gel coated surface nick\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I have sealed leather wallets I want to use this pen to write the boys last name on the wallet, will it stay?\n Answer:","completion":" Not exactly sure what pen you're referring to (Amazon doesn't include the item in your request-that's kind of dumb). But anyway I looked over my history and the only pen I bought was a hunter green paint pen thing. If that's it, I used it to touch up a scraped up decal on my work truck. It is still on there and holding up so hopefully that helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between this set &amp; the set of 60 which is about the same price?\n Answer:","completion":" i would guess that there are several more colors. if it's the same price as the 48 pen set, i'd go with the 60. i love the pens. they color like the copics - nice and even - AND you can color your stamps with them to make the impression. i can't do that with copics. the copics dry too fast. i really enjoy my Faber Castell Pitt Brush Pens.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these specifically the \"Big Brush\" pens?\n Answer:","completion":" No, these are not. The Big Brush pens are sold in a different set.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the ink waterproof? If I use them on glossy paper will they smear?\n Answer:","completion":" Although I haven't tried them specifically on glossy paper, I have tried them on several non-paper surfaces (such as a semi-gloss canvas). If you give the ink ample time to dry (will be tacky after just a few minutes and then totally dry after several hours) then it will likely not smear. However, if I went back to the canvases that I've done with them and wiped a damp cloth across, I'm rather certain the ink would smudge, so I do not believe that the ink is waterproof.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these appropriate for direct coloring on rubber stamps? I cannot see how big the brush is. Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I think that they don't work for rubber stamps. They have a regular size, not like a sharpie, and there are washable, you need brush like a sharpie for that kind of work\n"}

I use mine for chisels, plane blades and repairing the ends of borrowed screwdrivers. A slow speed grinder and any one of the sharpening jigs would be a better choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: In the product description, its mentioned \"Use of power converters for 220V not recommended\" - risk of damaging the motor or reduced efficiency?\n Answer:","completion":" When a power converter is used only the volts are converted, not the hertz (or cycles). 120v uses 60hz while 220v uses 50hz. Converting from 220 to 120 will cause a motor to run slower than intended, while converting from 120 to 220 will cause it to run faster than the manufacturer intended. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i use this to sharpen a corner chisel?\n Answer:","completion":" I doubt it. You could flatten the outside but the bevel on the inside edges would not be accessible. A fine set of diamond files is the best. Second is flat thick glass and a very fine abrasive laid to the edge such as micro mesh and carefully drawing the interior edges along the edge of the glass. The flat is simple.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Apologies if this is a dumb question. Would this sharpen clipper blades? They are sharpened flat and I would like this for woodworking as well.\n Answer:","completion":" apologies if this is a dumb answer, but this machine can only sharpen small blades. because of the way it works, you couldn't use it on a kitchen knife. so how long are chipper blades?\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this adjust to punch holes in paper for a 5.5 x 8.5 binder?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, although it requires a little effort. You need a screwdriver to move the punchers, so it isn't something that is convenient if you need to go back and forth frequently.\n"}

It is heavy duty, but for your application I am not sure if you require better one. From the other hand, Amazon has excellent returning policy. FYI: the stapler is made in China.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be able to punch through a piece of felt or fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" I just tried it with both felt and cotton fabrics. A single layer punches ok, but fabric and felt were both 'pulled' into hole and punched hole had to be finished with scissors.. Double layers of both cut fine and were stiff enough to cut hole all the way through without having to trim with scissors. Triple layer of cotton punched fine; but felt was too thick.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many sheets of paper can you punch at one time?\n Answer:","completion":" It will allow 25 sheets of 24 lb paper, but I don't think I would make a habit of punching that many at a time as I believe it would cause great wear on the punches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How far from the edge of the page does the hole punch? Is this distance adjustable?\n Answer:","completion":" Erm... the normal distance? :) I will try to remember to look at work tomorrow. It is not adjustable. You can, of course, change where the holes are in relation to the vertical distance of the page, but I dunno about the horizontal one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the distance from the top of the page to the top of the holes?\n Answer:","completion":" The distace is 1\/4 inch. There is really no way to adjust that distance.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it include the paper guide?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it made of metal? or plastic?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi there, It is definitely made out of metal! It's a great hole puncher. I hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will it punch just one hole?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the distance between the two holes? I need it to punch holes in 5 inch wide pieces of paper and want to know where the holes will punch.\n Answer:","completion":" The distance between the two holes is 2 3\/4 inches on center. The punch includes an adjustable papeer guide which allows you to move the paper from side to side. The distance between the two holes is not adjustable. Hope this helps you out!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many punchers does it have?\n Answer:","completion":" It has two.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the distance between the punches?\n Answer:","completion":" 2.75 inches - not adjustable\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this to punch two holes in index cards? I need to do that so that I may carry the stack with me with binder rings.

{"prompt":"Question: does this punch 2 three quarter holes or one 2 3\/4 holes?\n Answer:","completion":" It punches two holes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there some basic instructions for a child to get started are even a DVD?\n Answer:","completion":" This set does not come with a DVD. It's not really meant, in my opinion for a younger (12 or under) child, unless the child has had prior instruction in using the different mediums or is so artistically inclined, they just \"know\" what to do. My daughter loves hers but does not get the use I wish she could have gotten from it. I feel I would have been better off if I would have bought her something far less complex. She was 9 when she received it as a Christmas gift and I don't think she will fully appreciate and use it until she is around 12 or 13. It has taught her to take much better care of her art supplies, though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the angle of the easel adjustable?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. There is a wing nut that allows you to make minor adjustments\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the shipping weight of this item? I need it for ouside U.S.\n Answer:","completion":" 10 lb.net wt. Add about 1 lb. for packaging.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there stopers on the botom of the easel to keep it from sliding on the table?\n Answer:","completion":" The easel is built into the box. And the box is heavy. I was surprised at hiw heavy it actually is. I would say the whole thing is a good 10lbs. Its a wonderful item. I don't see any issues with it sliding much. If u want to be causious about it u can get some little stick on stoppers for a little of nothing at a craft store. Its well worth the money. If ur getting it as a gift whom ever its for will absolutely love it. I know my 8 ur old daughter does\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: 1. do you put this on the desk or it can stand by itself on the floor? 2. is there any claim that the paints are non toxic?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a small box. Desk type.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I just received this item but in my mind's density, I can't figure out how to put the easel together. Can someone help me?\n Answer:","completion":" Did anyone help you? The top bar has to be removed and flipped forward for use, then reversed out of the way when the case is closed for travel. The wing nut inside holds it secure so it doesn't fall out of its slot if it's turned upside down. There are also two sets of wing nuts in a small plastic bag that aren't identical ... one set of two wings is longer and goes through the easel base near the hinges. The shorter two go through the sides. The round washers (flat disks) go inside on the screw and then the wing nut is screwed on top of that. This is so when the wing nut is tightened, it pushes against the metal washer and doesn't bore into the soft wood. Remember all the wings screw on inside the box, not outside. This way, if one falls off, it falls safely back into the box with its washer. It also prevents the box from snagging on anything it slides against. To adjust, pull up to your desired angle and screw down the wing nut on that side to hold it firm, then again on the other side. Hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine. Hope that helps. :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are canvas\/papers included with this set?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my set came without any directions on how to set the easel up any suggestions\n Answer:","completion":" It's not very hard. The bolts can go on either side of the easel but I set mine up to be on the outside. When I got mine, it never came with instructions. I just sat down and figured it out. Good luck\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: came with no directions.How do we put easel up\n Answer:","completion":" You will find bolt and nuts to fit into a slot. Easel opens and rests against slider bar and bolted into place. I had to figure this out by trial and error.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What age range is this suitable for?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say it shouldn't be for anybody under 8 years old.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What specific products are included?

From there you can also find some videos that demonstrate how to use the products that come with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How big (LxW) of a mold can you make with this kit if the desired depth is roughly 3\/8\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Probably at least 3 feet by 3 feet. You get a lot of mold compound and a lot of casting plastic. I have made 5-6 4 inch by 4 inch by 2 inch molds and I still have over half the molding compound left. It depends on what you are casting, I suppose.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be able to make very thin molds (1\/8\" or thinner) of small surface decorations?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How much stuff included ?\n Answer:","completion":" 2 lbs rubber. 2 lbs plastic. Enough to do a small project. Worked for me. Coincidentally I am going to their training class in Pennsylvania in a few weeks.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I would like to mold a wolverine claw which is 12\" long and 3\/8 thick and 1 1\/2\" wide, I also would like to make it a 2 part I think top and bottom...\n Answer:","completion":" The resin that comes with it is pretty light weight. It would make a nice prop, with paint, but I wouldn't test it for functionality. On a 1 - 10 for difficulty I'd say that would be about a 2 with this kit. Depending on your expectations this could be a good kit for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm planning on doing some small casts of a metal object. Can the casting mold withstand the temperature of molten pewter 170&ndash;230 &deg;C (338&ndash;446 &deg;F)?\n Answer:","completion":" I really doubt it. The mold is silicone and probably won't take temps that high. I really don't know for sure though. I do know when the pour-able plastic \"goes off\" its gets uncomfortably hot, but not into those ranges. Sorry, I hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it have paw prints (cats and dogs)?\n Answer:","completion":" No paw prints. Just full cat and dog stencils.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: ill they work for making cards?\n Answer:","completion":" I would think so. You can use the stencil on card stock for a nice outline. The stencil is to make an outline of the shape\/object, there is no detail (I.e eyes, fins, leaves) you would sketch that in if you are looking for more detail.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you have the multiple layer stencils stencils\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this set have dolphins and turtles?\n Answer:","completion":" No it has neither Dolphins not turtles\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have super basics as well, like hearts and stars?\n Answer:","completion":" They have a heart for valentine's day with the ruffles but I'm not certain on a star. They don't have variations of those two items.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this only work when plug in?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, without the light powered and turned on it doesn't serve a purpose other than being a flat, white surface to work on.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this unit usable with cardstock?\n Answer:","completion":" It should be ok for use with card stock, but as is the case with any thicker paper, it is just naturally more opaque.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I see that this box comes with 1 8 watt bulb. Is there room to add another 8 watt bulb? I'm seeing the same box elsewhere with 2 8 watt bulbs.\n Answer:","completion":" To be honest l have not opened it up. l thought it had two bulbs myself.The box is not with me at the moment so l can't check what the packaging states.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the work face dimensions for this box?\n Answer:","completion":" The size of a regular piece of paper, the one I bought. However, they come in all kinds of sizes. Many people make their own. Modeled after the ones used in Reggio Amelia, Italy in pre school an kindergarten classes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it have hardware or fixtures for it to be mounted to the wall?\n Answer:","completion":" No. Only the little kickstand for setting it at a slight angle on a table\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there space to slide a paper underneath the plexiglass for tracing, or do you need to layer papers on top?\n Answer:","completion":" The plexiglass is riveted on and you cannot slide papers beneath it. Your best bet is to use tracing paper, or plain white paper that is translucent. I have also found that having a desk lamp that can be swung over the light box as needed can really help and is quicker and easier than turing the light box on or off to see how your tracing results look as you work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with light bulb? If not, what kind does it use, and where do I get one?\n Answer:","completion":" Comes with a bulb installed!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to go through thousands of negatives to determine whether to save for family, discard, print, convert to digital etc. Retired. OK for 35MM Review?\n Answer:","completion":" When referencing thousands of slides, the surface area of this light box is just too small (for any reasonable speed anyway.) Also, light fall off away from the bulb is too much for critical reviewing. BUT, for just putting slides on the unit and \"quickly\" looking for 1st pass \"go, no go\" analysis, it can suffice. You must keep the box fairly level to keep slides from falling off the box. Another positive is tha light box is relatively inexpensive. Also you'll be well served using a magnifying glass!! Have fun!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what kind of power does this have? and is it LED?\n Answer:","completion":" standard light bulb or cfl\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you easily remove one watch without disturbing the others?\n Answer:","completion":" yes definetly\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why are some reviewers saying it has a glass top and some saying it is plastic??\n Answer:","completion":" It's not glass. it is like plexi glass. its nice and clear like glass but more durable than glass. a lot harder to break it. when you touch it it can appear to feel and sound like glass especially if you never came in contact with plexi glass before. It is not glass though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this velvet lined, and I have several ceramic watches, worried about it not closing ?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it is velvet-like lined. I have never had a problem with any of my watches being damaged. I don't know if I'd travel with it because of the glass lid but it's perfect for at home.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i use it for bracelets\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! Each slot has a removable oval form that can accommodate most bracelets just as easily as it does a watch. I bought my case for storing my watches, but after doing so I still had almost the entire bottom row empty. I quickly gathered my favorite bracelets and put them in the case also. You can find the jewelry you want at a glance, and the removable forms make it easy to take a piece out and easy to put it away again. And it's so attractive I leave it sitting out on my bedroom vanity. I love this case!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could this also be used for bracelets? Could it be used for bangles that do not open in the back?Could you use it for bracelets that are not flexible?\n Answer:","completion":" Sure, most definitely. The bands that hold the watch or bracelets in place are flexible. It's would be good for bangles but remember the lid does have to close.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this case accommodate larger watches (51mm)?\n Answer:","completion":" The short answer is \"YES\"...I mentioned this in my review which is probably buried in there with a lot of others so will mention this again. The watch will accommodate a 51mm diameter watch (except on the 4 corner slots of the case where the lid will impinge on them). The problem is the slots are spaced close together so you cannot have several watches greater than 45mm (that is including the crown) in a row without them touching one another\/moving them askew to fit. If you look at the picture the watches are on the smallish side so it looks ok. I would estimate that they're no larger than 35mm (inc crown). If you skip a space between your watches, alternate your smaller\/larger pieces, or don't plan to fill it with larger watches it should be fine (of course then it won't hold 18 watches). But if you have more than a few watches and they're all larger, I would recommend another case. Good luck and post a review of what you find.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will the large g shocks fit?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is watch holder removable? Meaning, can I take it out and have just a display box for something else?\n Answer:","completion":" I suppose you could. The watch holder is a solid foam block glued in place with slots cut out for the watches. Would be a bit of work and the results might not be very neat but I suppose it could work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the watch come with the box?\n Answer:","completion":" I think so..? Nothing special but decent. Removed it from the box and tied it with a ribbon instead:)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size are these\n Answer:","completion":" These are really small. Hard to hang on to them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how can I measure to determine what size I need ? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" If you mean the post of your existing earring these Backs are friction fit but posts are various sizes. I found these very small Backs only worked on the smallest posts. If you are asking are these Backs the size you need for your existing earrings, they only work for small, lightweight earrings. Because they are very small they do not support very much weight or size which results in the earring falling forward because the Back isn't big enough in diameter size to hold the earring upright on your ear.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these \"screw\" on?\n Answer:","completion":" they look like they push on, but i did not receive ones i ordered, so i am not 100% sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do they fit thick or thin posts?\n Answer:","completion":" thin posts. I could not use them because the posts of the earrings I bought them for are too large.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why do these 14k gold earring backs stick to a magnet? I just received 8 pairs and they all stick to a magnet. Pure gold does not stick to a magnet.\n Answer:","completion":" i'm no expert. but like you said pure gold does not stick to magnet. and correct me if im wrong but 14k is not pure gold....\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need backs for a small gold post...will these work ? (by small I mean the post is small and requires a backing with a narrow opening)\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I think they would work. The back of them would hold the post and would keep them safely on. Plus I believe the hole would be small enough also.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size(mm) are these ---\n Answer:","completion":" 5 mm by .9 mm or 3\/16 inches by 5\/32 inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My posts are very thin (1mm), will these work?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure if this helps, but I purchased these backs for my daughter's pearl earrings. The posts were slightly bigger that the 1mm you have. The backs that came with the earrings were messed up and too large. These were slightly larger but the metal is soft. The holes are not 1mm size. Just slightly bigger. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this block rust or chip after any length of time?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, I have used mine to make rings from coins by hammering the coin while rotating the edge of the coin held perpendicular to the block, so far no rusting or chipping has occurred... I place mine in the cardboard box it comes in and I wipe it with an oily rag when I put it away and it still looks new.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the dimensions 4\" x 4\"?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, the dimensions are precisely 4\" x 4\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the exact weight of this block?\n Answer:","completion":" The block weighs: 1.072 kg\/37.8 oz\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this block stainless steel or just a steel benchblock? one reviewer said it came with a thin coat of oil on it, that would make it just tooled steel.\n Answer:","completion":" I am pretty sure it is tooled steel. There was oil on it. It works pretty good, at least for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kind of amps breaker does this kiln take? Thank you\n Answer:","completion":" The circuit barker for that outlet is 20 amps\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this oven sustain 1947 degreese\n Answer:","completion":" It worked great for what about four\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this oven programmable?\n Answer:","completion":" The only settings on this particular oven is for temp. It's a very basic oven. We bought it for destructive testing on our products, so this was perfect for us.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long is it safe to run this? I'm looking to heat treat some ceramic fiber material that requires ~900C for 4 hours.\n Answer:","completion":" We have ran this unit at 1200F around 4-5 hrs with no problems. We've been testing the coating on our flanges with good success at these temps at 4 - 5 hrs each time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used for knife making?\n Answer:","completion":" It melts metal I think do to the different ways out there on making knifes you need to bing or google do some reading on it it might get you rough start of knife but best to make sure big buy so if knifes are what you want check into it first.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi - Does it look exactly as in picture?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, but do check the size as i can't tell that from the photo.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would this work well with sticking them on cardstock for 'handmade' name tags?\n Answer:","completion":" It would need to be very thick card stock or laminated. They would work though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it 30 for 1.78?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this tumbler for silver filled jump rings\n Answer:","completion":" yes we use it for jump rings and it seems to strengthen the silver a bit for better stability\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How Long Does it Take to Tumble about 1 Lb of 1 inch rough Rocks to a very Smooth Size, what else would I need Beside this Tumbler To Get them \"Satin Glossy Looking\" Like the one sold in Stores ?\n Answer:","completion":" You probably will only be able to put 5 or 6 rocks at a time into this tumbler. There are 4 polish powders, and each takes at least 7 days. Course grit, fine grit, pre polish powder, and polish powder. I would suggest you use the course grit for more than 7 days if these are very rough. I only polish agates, and they are not rough at all. you're looking at about 28-30 days for shiny. The one thing I found about the last step with the polishing powder is it sticks in cracks. Be wary of that, then use a toothbrush to scrub out as much as you can. Rock polishing is not quick.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I create handmade sea or beach glass with this tumbler? Thanx!!\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! check this out:http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/how_6658044_make-glass-using-rock-tumbler.html\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: If you're new to jewelry and tumbling, would you get this 3 pound size or go for $50 more and get the 6 pounder? I don't want to over or under-buy.\n Answer:","completion":" 3 Pound is the way to go for starting out. Should you wish to expand at one point getting an extra 6 pound one would probably be a nice option\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Why is it called a \"kit\"? Does it come with shot?\n Answer:","completion":" That's a good question! It does come with an extra band for the motor but no shot.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I get the barrel open? I can't make the lid budge! Does it unscrew? Does it \"peel off\"? Help!\n Answer:","completion":" Unscrew retaining nut, remove washer, slowly working the edge ply the metal lid up. Careful not to damage the rubber, for inner rubber covered lid, gently pull rubber barrel edge back to release pressure\/vacuum, then pull up inner rubber covered lid. It can be pulled by the stud that held the nut inplace.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: i want to make burlap curtians is will this work fine? they are going to have a hem so i figured it would work but just wanted to be sure.\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see why they would not work for that. They should be able to handle the weight of the burlap\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the overall size if this hook\n Answer:","completion":" They are about two and a half inches high.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do these work as shower curtain hangers? Do they scratch the bar? Do they make a lot of noise? Do they get stuck?\/overlap eachother?\n Answer:","completion":" They are metal so if you have a low quality\/painted shower curtain rod, they will scratch the bar. No more so than other metal shower curtain rings though. You would need hooks with balls on the top to prevent scratching. They don't get stuck or overlap each other if you're using a traditional shower curtain (which has individual holes for each hook). I've used these hooks for other Pinterest-y projects (a tie rack and belt rack) and they can get tangled up and clank a little in that case but never saw this or heard any excessive noise when using them with my actual shower curtain. These are just very basic but very sturdy hooks and with 50, you'll never run out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would this be good to hang my homemade ferret hammocks in my ferrets cage\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sure, if there isn't too much weight in the hammock. I used them to gang patio curtains.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking to hang misc stuff in a closet turned craft center. Would these be able to fit over the wooden clothes rod in the closet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! That's exactly why I got mine and they're perfect. Have fun getting your craft area organized.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this mandrel have a groove?\n Answer:","completion":" I just got it today and it sure does. Very disappointed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do you use it for enlarging rings?\n Answer:","completion":" I will start with saying that I am NOT a jeweler. Here is what I do. Put the ring on the mandrel. Put a piece of PVC pipe on top of the ring. Use a rubber mallet and tap the PVC pipe, pushing the ring down the mandrel. The PVC pipe provides even pressure all the way around so that the ring doesn't get wonky. Tap the ring to about one size smaller than you want it to be then turn the ring over and finish to the proper size. Do this so the ring doesn't take on a cone shape. I will end this with I am NOT a jeweler, just a hobby ring maker. I have not yet mastered any part of this, but this seems to work best for me. There are presses made that are more advanced and easier, but much more expensive. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the diameter of the tip of the mandrel? (where the ring is put)\n Answer:","completion":" Using my rather inexpensive digital caliper, and realizing that the very tip ( that is maybe the first 1\/32 nd of an inch)is tapered in sharply, the tip is approx. 8.8 mm tapering out fatter to 9.45 mm at the #1 ring size mark. If you aren't familiar with mm size think that a dime is like 16 mm in diameter. Hope that helps...maybe use a medal dap set to round objects so as to fit them on?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the diameter at the thickest part?\n Answer:","completion":" Ring size 15 or 1 inch\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What are you guys talking about when you say \"does it have a groove\"? And why is that undesirable? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" some mandrels have a longitudinal grove which is ok for sizing but not for making coin rings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Some people have said it is not accurate. Accuracy is all I care about. How accurate is it?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine is pretty accurate. I haven't mic'd it because there's been no need. Never had a problem\n"}

But I do like it a lot. Very heavy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this come with everything you see in the picture?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it does. It is an awesome kit. I got it for my five year old. She loved painting it all, and arranging all the pieces. The seeds sprouted and grew within 3-4 days. A good buy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would an adult enjoy this, or just for children? thx\n Answer:","completion":" I bought this for my 7 yrs old and she enjoyed it. I did read the reviews before i purchased and a few mentioned the amount of soil was inadequate. I agree as some of the pieces would not stand up in the little amount and we had to lean them against other pieces. The painting was fun but did not take long to do. I would say that children might enjoy this more than an adult.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this kit be placed in an outdoor garden once assembled?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it the weather conditions are right there would be no problem. I don't know how permanent the paint would be. There might be some kind of sealer available at the hardware store that would make it more permanent. We found it to be pretty sturdy, but it was always kept indoors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We recieved our fairy garden kit, but without the seeds. There is no visiblempacket of seeds, is it in the soil bag?\n Answer:","completion":" Our seeds were in a separate baggy none in the soil.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Mine is not growing anything! The dirt seems to be more like sand, am I supposed to use my own soil to get these seeds and beans to grow?\n Answer:","completion":" My Granddaughter used just the soil in the kit. Hers grew very quickly. You could probably add some garden soil to make it grow.\n"}

I use acrylics. .Do I need to prep or can I paint right on it?i\n Answer:","completion":" You could just paint but the first coat will absorb into the wood and your painting won't be on the surface.

{"prompt":"Question: where is it made?\n Answer:","completion":" China\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can it be used to glue wallpaper in a dollhouse?\n Answer:","completion":" After having a 35 year career in miniatures building and teaching, I can guarantee that \"Yes\" glue is the ONLY glue I ever used!!! Fabulous. If too stiff, use hot water and dilute in VERY TINY increments stirring as you go until it becomes like thick syrup. A lot of book binders also use this glue. Cheers! Brooke Tucker\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the best way to spread this stuff? I need a good glue to adhere two 81\/2x11 sheets of bond (copy) paper.\n Answer:","completion":" I use an old credit card or those free mock-up ones that come with credit card offers. Old gift cards work well too. Someone else said to use a brayer to smooth out the glue and make the paper stick well, that sounds like a good idea. My old jar is a little drier and thicker than my new jar of paste so I would spritz a light mist of water on top of the glue if it is a little thick so the paper can be slid over the paste to get wrinkles out. Otherwise it holds in place right away when I lay the paper down and wrinkles are harder to get out. If you jar is very fresh you might not need to do this--I would try a sample sheet of paper first to determine how it works for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If you use it to mount a 20x30 photo to a foam board will the picture stay without coming off?\n Answer:","completion":" I used this glue to put wallpaper in a doll house. I can say that it will most likely stay. Since it is a water based glue, I wouldn't put the picture into a \"wet\" area, like a bathroom. I hope that this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will it stick paper to metal?\n Answer:","completion":" I suppose it would, if you rough sanded the metal to give it some \"tooth\".\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How long does a thin coat take to dry? 1-5 hours? Overnight? 30 min.? Plan to affix print to wood panel and coat with epoxy resin.\n Answer:","completion":" Less than an hour if applied thinly. Of course it depends on where you live & the temperature, etc. You need to prepare the glue to accomodate whatever you are gluing. The heavier the object, the thicker the glue should be (hence a longer drying time). Only activate the top layer of glue in your container. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Howdy. Do you guys know if it will bond a photo to mat board (perfectly)? I've had problems with the \"plastic-like\" finish on the backs of photos. .\n Answer:","completion":" yes if you spread evenly and then i use a brayer to roll the two together it gives even pressure and spreads the paste out ... this paste liguifies as up spread it.. love it\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall are these letters?\n Answer:","completion":" They are about 1\/4 inch. A lot smaller than I had hoped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this set include a frame to line the letters up and stamp a whole word together or do I have to stamp each letter individually?\n Answer:","completion":" No, there is no frame. This set is more of a small disposable set. What we use them for is to mark poker hand cards during a motorcycle poker run for the American Legion Riders. They work perfect for that sort of thing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this be good for stamping on clay?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: hello someone could tell me if I can work with these stamps on fabric\n Answer:","completion":" they could but I prob. wouldn't recommend it... don't know how well they would show up\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use these with chalk ink (stamp pad)?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure. I just bought stamp pads from amazon and Walmart and they were fine. Teeny tiny stampers, but the kids like them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My father has many medals. Will this scrapbook accommodate medals nicely? The book looks beautiful.\n Answer:","completion":" I would not suggest to have medals in this book. It is a nice scrapbook, as I am putting together my fiances Army career in this, but I have his medals in a shadow box, made for coins, medals etc. I think medals would be too heavy on the pages. Hope this helps!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the insert pages... they are for 12x12 paper right?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, they are.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: norma, thanks for answering my question. but i have another question. i found 2 screws in the front of the book. how do you remove tbem?\n Answer:","completion":" Open the back panel of the book and you'll see a fold, lift it up to expose the screws. Kelly\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you add pages to this scrapbook? if so, how does it come apart?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you can add pages. It has the regular scrapbook screws. They are easy to work with.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do the pages attach inside the album? Is is a 3 ring binder?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it's not a three ring binder. There are screws that come apart. You can add as many pages as you like. You will need to add extra screws later if you need a lot of pages.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this cut fabric with the sizzle fabric quilting dies?\n Answer:","completion":" No, I dont believe so. There are special machines made just for that purpose. The cuttlebug cuts papers, light cardboard,vinyl and thin foam. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this in fact the older (original) model and not the new one? Lot's of places post the photo of the older model but in fact it is the newer V2.\n Answer:","completion":" This embosser is the current model but NOT the NEW ONE. That one is called New Blue Cricut Cuttlebug. It was just released there IS a new Cuttlebug and according to this new link they can be pre-ordered at Amazon and available Nov 1 2013, but I cannot find that option on Amazon's site???? http:\/\/www.4-traders.com\/news\/Cricut-Introduces-New-Blue-Cricut-Cuttlebug-Embosser-and-Die-Cutter--17332113\/ The current model hasn't been out very long (a few years maybe) and was not as nice as the original model they replaced it with. Maybe this new one will be better! Longer plates and loading shelf would be nice!! That's all I know! Mine broke in earlier this year and I went out and got a Tim Holz Vagabond which is WONDERFUL and much more versatile and only about $139 last I saw here at Amazon with free shipping. My choice hands down to Cuttlebug, and if I wanted a manual machine again I would buy the Sizzix Big Shot which interchanges with all the Vagabond plates etc!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this machine cut as well as emboss? I'm confused as to how it works.\n Answer:","completion":" It cuts as well as embosses. It works just like the Sizzix machine, you can even use some of the sizzix cartridges. The cuttlebug is just slightly smaller than the sizzix.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does the Cuttlebug work?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello fellow crafter,You need to have embossing folders, plates (A,B and B).If you are die cutting you will need plate C. And paper. Simply place the paper inside of your chosen folder,. You will use plates B and B with A through the machine and turn until the folder reaches the other side, If you die cut you will need a template along with the plates and an additional cloth to protect the plates. There a demo available on YouTube if you needhelp. You can get additional materials from amazon.com Hope the this was helpful. Have fun!!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many plates are used?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Melissa, To emboss you need plates A and 2 B's To die cut , you need the C plate and a rubber sheet pad to protect the plates as well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My Cuttlebug Anna Griffin die will not feed through machine without excessive force. Am afraid I will break either the plates or machine. Suggestions?\n Answer:","completion":" Are you using this sandwich: A plate & die between 2 B plates? How thick is the die? If it is excessively thick you might have to just force it. At mop B plateost it will bend the top B plate. I have not used Anna Griffin dies ao I really don't know but experiment with different combos, til you get the right one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The handle got slack on the machine and it is no longer working, what can I do to fix it?\n Answer:","completion":" You should be able to remove the handle and tighten the screw.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this cut fabric with the sizzle fabric quilting dies?\n Answer:","completion":" I have no idea. Try it with a sample piece.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this machine cut felt?\n Answer:","completion":" I have tried with foamy and works well, I have not tried with felt, when I do I'll let you know.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the machine cut vinyl?\n Answer:","completion":" Since it a hand operated machine, I would not recommend it for vinyl.. Try looking at the Cricut or the Silhouette. I have owned all three and much prefer the Silhouette cameo for vinyl.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this product a punch itself or do you need to buy another product that this fits into?\n Answer:","completion":" It's just like a hole puncher- just bigger :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this 2.5' scalloped punch able to work as a border for a 2' circle punch to nest in the center? Anyone use it for this?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. That is exactly what I use it for and it comes out beautifully. I have a 3.5\", 2.5\" and 1.5\" scallop along with a 3\", 2\" and 1\" circle. They look really great building the three sets and putting them on top of each other with pops.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Confused, how big are the scalloped circles that you end up with 2.5\" or 5.5\"?\n Answer:","completion":" 2.5\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this also cut felt material? I need 2 1\/2\" felt circles\n Answer:","completion":" The blades are pretty sharp, and I am able to cut 2-3 pieces of card stock at once. I'm guessing it should cut felt with no problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is there a place for negatives when you just order the case only?\n Answer:","completion":" The case has a bottom storage side that's shallow, good for negatives or for larger photos, 5x7 etc or other souvenir items. Also the photo dividers are movable allowing for flexibility\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many pictures does it hold?\n Answer:","completion":" 1800 to 2000 depending how you squeeze them in...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many dividers are there\n Answer:","completion":" There are five sections on both sides for a total of ten areas to separate your pictures. There are eight plastic dividers that can be removed to combine more pictures in one area. 6 3\/8 inches wide x 4 1\/2 tall. I wish it came with the plastic sleeves for the pictures. When I bought these at Costco several years ago they did.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the case come with the plastic dividers and acid free index cards?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does. However the down side is that the order I placed arrived busted in areas around the snaps. Returns were easy, but the replacement item also had damage. Living in Hawaii means sacrifices, I had to sacrifice this one. It was a better deal to have a friend pick one up and ship it to me. Somehow that one arrived in perfect condition.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size of hole this punch can drill?\n Answer:","completion":" this drills a regular size hole, just like a regular hole punch. 1\/4 inch.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could you punch a decent hole through a stack of about 100 ziploc bags with this device?\n Answer:","completion":" yea i think so. i was able to punch through over 100 sheets of thick paper. so i assume as long as the ziplocs dont slip and slide the punch itself will be able to get through it. before you use it on anything you care about test it on some crap material because there's some oil residue that needs to come off after the first couple of punches. then it's good to go. the way the device works is you put the items you want to punch under it and then you tighten and as you do that (by screwing the metal) it slowly \"punches\" through. it's more like a drill press than it is a punch. you don't slam down on the punch to get through the paper which is why it seems to be able to punch through so much. it's a slower process for sure but it's excellent.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Where can I buy the 1\/8 inch McGill hole punch. I need 3\n Answer:","completion":" While they are currently out of stock it appears that you can purchase them directly from McGill.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the spacing between the back of the drill base and the drill bit? I am needing to punch a coupel 1000 holes about 1\" into a piece of paper.\n Answer:","completion":" I have the 1\/4\" one, I just measured with calipers and it's .411\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: We have emergency information flip charts that have 10 pages of card stock and a clear cover. They are already put together with 5\/16\" in. plastic splines at the top. Will this adjustable drill be able to accomodate this.\n Answer:","completion":" The spine will not fit within the area that you place the stack of papers to drill. Hope this helped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size are these?\n Answer:","completion":" The big ones are about 3\/4ths of an inch and the small ones are a little less than half an inch. They rip very easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what are the 3 colors?\n Answer:","completion":" Black, Gold, and Silver Pretty good stickers. Have to be careful pulling them off though, easily ripped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are these stickers paper or vinyl?\n Answer:","completion":" No. They're regular stickers. So upset. Bought them to use as stencils for a diy project to make your own coffee mug, when I stuck the stickers on, they wouldn't come off and left a sticky mess. Smh. Waste of money.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this pack include numbers as well?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you all one color in the pack of 840?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure as I sent it to my granddaughter in Germany. From the picture I assumed it was different color pages. Oh, different types of lettering but the colors are black, gold and silver.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could it be used as a reverse stencil, put it down, paint over it, peel up and have the letter in \"unpainted\" negative space?\n Answer:","completion":" I suspect it could. The problem is getting them off of the sheet as they tear easily.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: are these ok for scrapbooking? 12x12 page\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. @daveth3king\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the decals waterproof?\n Answer:","completion":" They stick very well but doubt that water exposure would be wise.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you sell single letters? I need 250 \"K's\" and 250 \"T's\" I need it in gold and in your script font that you sell in the 6 sheet multi-colored pack.\n Answer:","completion":" No, I am sorry we don't.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would it be possible to print white lettering to this and then apply it to a black surface?\n Answer:","completion":" Not unless you have a white ink cartridge. Inkjet printers \"print\" white by simply not laying down any ink at all based on the assumption that the paper being printed on is white. You'd have to replace the black ink cartridge with a white one and set the font color to black for this to work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I \"reverse print\" on these sheets so that I can place them inside an office window, readable from outside the office window?\n Answer:","completion":" Miles, Strictly speaking with regard to the product, no. The adhesive side is backed by a peel off layer that you remove only after printing. That said, you can achieve what you want to do with this product. If you are using MS Word, for example, you can type your message in a \"text box\", and then select \"format\" the text box, select \"3D rotation\", put \"180\" deg in the \"X\" axis, and the text is reversed. Print it that way and stick it to the window. It will be readable outside of your office window, which is your goal. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this sticker removable? reusable?\n Answer:","completion":" Doesn't seem to be either of these....it's pretty well stuck to my classroom window and when I pry it off in June, I don't see it going back on...how disappointing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used on a boat\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't think so. It is very flimsy paper that you print on and peel off the back, but it wouldn't last in water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used these on a wooden surface? I'm looking for something for my son to use on his Pinewood Derby car. Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" I use this adhesive for logo labels for wooden signs I create...and it works great!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could I use this over a \"peeling label\" sticker (i.e., curling up on the edges) to help the original sticker stay down?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, you are able to seperate the adhesive film with the actual paper. You can cut it down to size if it is needed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you use these sheets in a color laser printer?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could you use this to transfer a photo onto a coffee mug?\n Answer:","completion":" This is a clear plastic with adhesive back. You can print onto the clear plastic, cut it out and stick it on the mug, but it will not stay on permanently.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this dishwasher safe? I am making cute mason jar water bottles with saying on them, is this the right product for them?\n Answer:","completion":" They are not very flexible so sticking them on a mansion jar not might work. Try the labels that are made by Avery\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these be used on water bottles that can go in dishwasher??\n Answer:","completion":" I have tried that and they melt in dishwasher. Hand wash only\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: physical dimensions and weight\n Answer:","completion":" footprint is 18\" x 15 1\/2\", and only weighs about 5 pounds (or less). Lighttop trace area is about 12 x 18. unit is 3\" deep at baack and about 3\/4 inch at front edge.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it trace on fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" I have never tried to trace on fabric - I guess if fabric is lightweight, you could tape it on and trace on it - if it was heavier weight, the light probably would not shine through well\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this electric\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. A Great purchase\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you attach paper so it doesn't move. Is it magnetic?\n Answer:","completion":" Tape. Your thumb. A large brick. A small child. Sorry for the sarcasm. Assuming you're an artist, get creative. I tape what I'm tracing to the back of my drawing paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is warrant period\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure if I fully understand what you're asking but the instructions say: \"Artograph projectors are guaranteed against all defects in material and workmanship for five years from the date of sale to the original purchaser.\" There are some conditions, such as registering the product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the light even across the surface and does it work well for the transfer of embroidery patterns to lightweight fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" I transfer patterns onto flour sack towels, and it is satisfactory.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this to transfer a portrait on canvas?\n Answer:","completion":" No, this is for line\/image tracing. It is a bright back light that allows you to see through cloth or paper and transfer the lines onto paper or cloth above it (without having to tape or hold the image up to a window for backlighting to trace it). What you need is called an Opaque Projector, where you can put a photo under the machine and it projects it onto a wall or canvas.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does anyone out there use this for calligraphy? I'm wanting to be able to see the guide lines without marking them out on the paper.\n Answer:","completion":" I can see through quilting cotton fabric. You should be able to see through any paper. I can try later today with a 28 lb paper and see if I can view through.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can the light shine through medium to dark fabric for tracing quilt designs?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it can. I use it for placing my paper pieces to fussy cut the fabric. Only bad comment is the electrical cord is short.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is a replacement light easily available in stores?\n Answer:","completion":" These light boxes do use a standard bulb of type F15T8-D. (The F15 denotes 15 watt, the T8 is the bulb style, and \"D\" denotes that it has a Daylight 6500K color temperature.) Amazon ASIN B001HXGNN2 is an example of such a bulb, and this may be available through hardware stores or home improvements as well.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this something that can be used by children?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say no. They are kind of hard to remove and really wet. If mine get tilted sideways, they run. Dye inks are waterbased, so I would use those for kids. Chalk inks stain and can be hard to clean up.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this big enough for thumb prints?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes the widest part is a bit more than an inch\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use it on canvas?\n Answer:","completion":" I am sorry, I do not know, I've just used with stamps in card stock.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this ink on cuttlebug folders? If so, does it wash off the folder easily?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I used in embossing folders and I washed it with water.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do the colors show up on black paper? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" they do, but not much. the ink is pretty translucent, some colors more than others. you don't get vivid results. for that you would have to emboss it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: By chance, is it possible to use a small paint brush to rub into the inkpad and catch enough of the ink to \"paint\" it on very small areas?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. It would require rebrushing on ink pad often though. i use a small sponge to dab on these and then dab the sponge on paper and it works fine for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used on baby oneies for permanent stamping\n Answer:","completion":" No, the ink is not permanent and will not survive washing. Have you considered inking the stamps with a sharpee?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is each dispenser 28 feet or is it a total of 28 feet for both?\n Answer:","completion":" Each dispenser has 28 feet in it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: photo safe?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. These tapes runners are acid free and PAT tested & approved, making them completely photo safe.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If you tape the edge of a piece of paper, will the tape only stick to the paper you are trying to glue, or will it run like a film beyond the edge?\n Answer:","completion":" I have used 3L tape runners for years and prefer it to glue every time. The tape runner will only stay where you put it. Hope this answers your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it repositionable?\n Answer:","completion":" It doesn't come off very easily once it's been pressed on firmly. So be sure you position it where you want it to be.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this work on fabric? I want to stick fabric to paper or plastic. Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" No sorry it will not work on fabric, made only for paper and photos. I tried to use on ribbon once and that didnt even work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it refillable.\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this DOUBLE-SIDED tape?\n Answer:","completion":" it is double sided. It rolls off the runner in very very small rectangular pieces...sticky on both sides\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what width is it? 1\/8\" 1\/4\" 1\/2\"\n Answer:","completion":" It's 1\/4\" wide and each tab is about 1\/16 long\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it sticky on both sides?\n Answer:","completion":" yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Did you use these alcohol inks on tile? And if so, did you use regular glazed white tiles? What did you use to seal them?\n Answer:","completion":" I have not used them on tile but have used the on metal and glass. I would experiment (the tiles are $.20 at Home Depot) with the white glazed ones. If you get the unglazed ones you will not be able to control the bleed because the porousness of the stone will absorb it. I did not have to seal it with anything when working with metal or glass. I would recommend not sealing it because you can get \"spots\" from the sealant.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these good mixed with watercolors for a pop?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't think so, the watercolors just by their composition, would negate the alcohol colors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these inks be used on ink pads\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can these inks be used on vellum... I thought I read that, but can't find it .... if so, can you comment on the results\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it can be used on Vellum with beautiful results. YouTube has good video.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can these be used as pigments for jewellers ICE resin?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say yes because the paper I used this on is glossy, it is NOT porous, therefore it doesn't absorb the ink, it only stains it. Maybe try a small spot and be sure it dries. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi! I wanted to use these to color copper for jewelry,do I have to seal it?If so what sealant?Thank you.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Make sure the copper paint is dry.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between this, and a silicone baking mat? Can they both be used the same way?\n Answer:","completion":" A silicone baking mat has some similar properties as the RANGER craft mat but it all depends on what your intended purpose for the mat is. If this is to be used for crafting, then the two mats have different properties and would be used (most likely) for different purposes. The RANGER mat is great for inking techniques. When you use an ink\/paint\/medium and water, it is very easy to transfer the ink to paper for cool\/interesting effects. Silicone mats do not react the same way. Water will still bead up, but it is difficult to move\/mix your medium and you prob. won't get the effects you want as easily as you would on the RANGER mat (in my experience). So while silicone mats will hold up better and most likely last much longer than a RANGER mat (you do not ever want to crease your RANGER mat, I messed up my first one b\/c I tossed it around and it got all crinkle-y on me and I had to replace it [learn from my mistake!]). But honestly, if you keep it flat [and don't use nail polish remover on it!!] you could keep your mat in fantastic condition and it would theoretically last as long as and continue to be as reusable as a silicone mat would be. Both mats are heat resistant, neither can be used as a cutting surface, and glue\/resin should peel off both mats. So if you just want something to protect you desk\/work surface from heat, glue gun, etc., a silicone mat is easier to maintain. But if you want something for inks, etc. OR you want a mat to use for techniques which are specifically to be used with the RANGER craft mat (aka a teflon mat), I would choose RANGER every time. Oh, AND IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GET A RANGER CRAFT MAT, MAKE SURE IT IS ACTUALLY MADE BY RANGER (the RANGER ones are the best I've used\/found.) Unless you want to order an off brand (you can get multiple off brand mats for the same price as the RANGER, but you'll get 2 or 3 mats instead of only 1 RANGER mat) so you don't have to worry so much about keeping the mat \"nice,\" and you could just toss it when it becomes too danaged (and grab another one). Either way should work out fine. This is only my 2 cents but I hope it helps!\n"}

I have many products by Ranger, and they have always been superior in quality. I bought another mat first, and it was much thinner and split when I folded it to take it with me to a crop.

{"prompt":"Question: Is this 120v to 220v by chance?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not at studio to look now, but am almost certain that it is only 110 v. The unit is not the beefy machine I'd hoped for, and is less serious than I was counting on. First, it overheats rather quickly when I've put it to serious use. Second, it has an annoying habit of running pressure down to almost nothing, and rather than kicking back on as supposed to, I have to manually bleed the remaining pressure out in order to get it to reboot and kick on to rebuild the full pressure (including the amount just sacrificed !) This little sequence is a constant deal, which further exacerbates overheating. I admit that my worst occasions happen in warm Denver weather on 85 + heat days, somehow that happens to be when the work really needs to be done, so I place fans directly on the unit and spray it down with lots of water to keep it going as long as possible. When it does shut off it is break time, or back to using it's smaller and older brother. Did I mention that the controls for setting pressure minimums seems to do nothing ? I'd say this unit is good for half hour bursts of work which do not require a lot of finesse.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Does it damage the wall if you take it off?\n Answer:","completion":" The adhesive on the back is pretty aggressive. It can be attached to a wall but depending on paint type and wall you are going to have to be very careful when you go to take it off. When you go to install it, it may be easier if two people work together. One to hold it it up while the other starts to mount it to the wall using your finger and a soft cloth. Work your way slowly from one corner and work out, make sure you press out all air bubbles as you install it. When you go to remove it there are a couple things to make it easier: One - use a hair dryer and warm the surface to the contact material. Two-start to peel it from one corner and peel it back at about a 45 degree angle while keeping it warm with the dryer. Adhesive clean up is pretty easy from there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I tape it to my desk, and then write on it? I would have my keyboard and books on the desk too, would it ruin the glue?\n Answer:","completion":" I think it can work.

{"prompt":"Question: Would this stick to painted lightly textured wall board? (it's painted with semi gloss paint)\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would stick.

{"prompt":"Question: Will this ruin a stainless steel refridgerator if I stick it on there?\n Answer:","completion":" I almost positive that it won't ruin it. It doesn't leave anything on my wall when I take it off to move it so it should be fine for the refrigerator!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Could it be cut and applied to the back of a laptop? (For situations that information is changing too quickly to type.)\n Answer:","completion":" Can definitely cut and put on laptop (I've cut it up and used it as labels for plastic bins) - I'm not sure whether it would be a useful way of jotting anything down, though, since all the writing get rubbed off when you put it into your laptop bag...\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I would like to use this to make a Chan Luu style wrap bracelet with dark brown leather and have it disappear against the leather, will it?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think it will disappear. When I use it for bead weaving, it shows. It isn't seriously obvious, but against something it will most likely show more. It has a kind of white tone to it. I hope this helps you make your decision.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is your thought for use for making anklets? I need something that is strong but not stiff.\n Answer:","completion":" I have been using this type of bead thread for a very long time, since using this type of thread. It is very rare that out of all the jewelry pieces I have made, I can count on one hand the times I have had anything break, with this thread. You wait when you try it, you will see how strong it is. Happy beading!!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this be used as warp on a loom\n Answer:","completion":" I was asked if I could answer this for you, although I use this Fireline bead thread and I must say in the years I have been using it not once has anything come apart that I have made with it. I can say I use the crystal 4ib\/size B and it is really strong. On Amazon you can get a better deal and more of this for your money. I would probably go higher then the one I use which is 0.006\" for your loom work. Give it a go, I would think it will do what you want it for. But I have not tried loom work before, so I can only say try it once it may be just what your looking for. Hope this helps a little, Liz.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this thread actually clear or white?\n Answer:","completion":" It is very pale. Almost clear but it doesn't show in your work unless you go through your beads several times.

{"prompt":"Question: Would this be strong enough to use for stringing large beaded necklaces? Need something strong but more supple\/flexible than tigertail type wires.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I love Fireline, but need red &amp; blue beading thread for hand weaving, would Nymo work just as well?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Make sure you check the size of the thread (b, d, etc) and use a thread conditioner. Thread magic and beeswax are good and makes it virtually snarl free.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this thread be appropriate for applying bugle beads to tulle for a wedding veil. (I'll need to knot it a lot of times.) If not, any suggestions?\n Answer:","completion":" It would work well if you get the 4 lb. test. That is fine, but also easy to cut with bugle beads. Standard practice is to use a seed bead on both ends of the stitch to keep the always sharp bugle beads from cutting the thread. That is a problem no matter which type of thread you use. I like to go through the beads twice too.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you cut fireline\n Answer:","completion":" hello Nora, I cut fireline with a scissors, usually the small embroidery type of scissors. Hope that helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is there enough paint for a 12X18 portrait? (I asked a similar question earlier but thought I should explain what I am painting)\n Answer:","completion":" it depends on what you're painting. i sue this paint for the final highlights because it is very thin. what are you painting? you need to do several layers with this paint because it is so thin.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there enough paint to cover one canvas of about 12X18 in size? I only plan to use it once for one painting for my room.\n Answer:","completion":" Are you using just one color? In that case it might not be. I would look to purchase a larger tube of just the one color.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would it be safe to use in a paper lantern? How much distance from the paper would you recommend?\n Answer:","completion":" I think that the light would work in a paper lantern since the bulbs don't get too hot You're probably going to put it right up the middle through the hole at the bottom,so that should be far enough away from the paper sides of the lantern.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would these work in the St. Nicholas Square Christmas Village pieces that they sell through Khols? Can't find brand specific part for that village.\n Answer:","completion":" Not familiar with Kohl's Christmas Village but I imagine the Heartland Valley would be suitable.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are these watercolor pencils ?\n Answer:","completion":" No. They are just regular color pencils.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the dimensions of the paper pad included and what would be the max refill size paper that would fit in this case.\n Answer:","completion":" The paper pad included is 5 inches by 7 inches, it is a 1\/4 inch thick. The actual case itself measures about 5 3\/4 x 10 3\/4 inches. I too wanted to figure out what refills could be used. 5 inches is the max width of the elastic bands inside which keep the pad in place. A 5.5 X 7.75 inch book 1\/2 inch thick does not fit in the elastic AND does not fit if you don't use the elastic. It is too wide to shut the case and get it zipped. You could fit something up to about 9 inches long, but you would have to keep the max thickness at or below 1\/2 inch otherwise you will not be able to close the case since the pencil sharpener will touch the pad - this is why they provide a 7 inch long pad - that way there is clearance at the top for the pencil sharpener. With the pencil sharpener intact you can place something up to about 3\/4 inch thick and still be able to zip the set closed. At 1 inch I could not get the case to zip. This was true for 5x7 and for 4x6. I chose this for refills. Will try to update once I have seen them. I went with 5x7 because the 4x6 just seems so small! http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001AR4E72\/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2IWCJ0AJPPRJZ\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is it a 2-hole penci sharpener?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. One smaller one larger. It's not an enclosed sharpener, the bits it sharpens off will just fall wherever.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is included?\n Answer:","completion":" The set has 12 pencils (see other question\/answer for types), an eraser, a pencil sharpener and a 5 X 7 inch drawing pad\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long are the pencils?\n Answer:","completion":" They r about average length.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it have somewhere to put the pieces of paper you draw on?\n Answer:","completion":" Unless you use the pitiful little pad provided in the kit, or you enjoy folded and crinkled drawings; then no.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size sketch book will fit in the space?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm guesstimating because I don't have it with me at the moment but definitely a 4x6 size would fit. Maybe a little bigger. I usually cut up pieces of sketch paper to put in for emergency doodling but I usually just carry around a normal sized pad.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do I get them sharpened. Can I get my small scissors sharpened Also\n Answer:","completion":" I found an address online to send them to be sharpened like new. Highly recommend. If I'm allowed to give you this info - go to Forveson online and follow their directions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I saw on another website that if they are not made in Italy they are not the good kind. Where are they made?. Does it say Italy\n Answer:","completion":" Says on the scissors made in \" Italy \" , hope this helps. I have 3 pair of Gingher Scissors to use when I weave. Mike\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between retail packaging and industrial packaging?\n Answer:","completion":" Retail packaging is similar to what we would see if we bought the item in a store. It'd be in a hard plastic casing, etc. Retail packaging is how I received these shears.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used these to cut leather? Curious if they would work for this purpose.\n Answer:","completion":" I suspect that you could cut leather but you would probably wear down the blades of the shears. I think that a person should have shears dedicated for different purposes(paper, cloth, leather)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where are they made?\n Answer:","completion":" Made in Italy. I am a made-in-USA kind of guy; in this case i made an exception, and could not be happier. Worth every penny. Great product!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm left-handed. Will the scissors work for me? Are there left-handed Gingher Applique Scissors?\n Answer:","completion":" While the finger holds are the same held either way, I do not think that you would find it satisfactory. The entire purpose of these is the large blade which protects you from cutting too much. Reversed you lose that protection because the larger blade would end up on the bottom. So I would not get these for a leftie. I found their contact info and included it below. Hope you can locate left-handed ones because they are just the ticket for cutting out tricky appliques and other close trimming work. The larger blade really does protect well.

{"prompt":"Question: can they be used to grade a seam allowance?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes I believe they would work well for this.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What about if you are left handed? Does the thumb opening hurt your hand if left handed?\n Answer:","completion":" I am left handed and use these to grade seam allowances. Gingher quality makes them precise cutting tools for grading seams. I used them upside down. Since I am only cutting a single layer there is no thumb pain as in using right handed scissors. I don't think that Gingher makes a left handed pair or I have never seen one.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How well does the cap stay on? Is this safe to throw in my pocket?\n Answer:","completion":" At first, the cap stayed on nice and snug. But now, for me at least, the cap is very loose and isn't strong enough to hold up its own weight, meaning if you have the knife upside-down in a cup or something, the cap will stay in the cup if you pick up the knife. I can't confirm that this will happen every time, however, because I've only owned the one knife.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the blade strong, or does it break easily?\n Answer:","completion":" strong\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to cut out very little letters?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes indeed. But you must be careful when cutting out stencils so that you do not over-cut the letter. An X-Acro knife is extremely sharp.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: has anyone tried to cut sheet metal with this yet? xD\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. Unless it's aluminum foil, I'd recommend a Dremel tool. If you're trying to score a piece of aluminum, this would work (briefly) but you'd be better off with a utility knife\/box cutter.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: clean up. Will it wipe off with water?\n Answer:","completion":" When I used it, any excess was easily removed with my finger, or tweezers. I used it on ribbon, metal wire, plastic. I often squeezed out more than I needed. It dries clear, and I used soap and water to remove any on my skin, without scrubbing. Based on the other answers here, it must depend on what you are using it on.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how to use it i never use it befor i will like to know befor i buy it\n Answer:","completion":" There isn't anything magic about it. It is simply a relatively enclosed place to blow the paint and\/or cleaner instead of spraying into a rag or into the air. You just poke the nose of your airbrush into the opening and use your trigger.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: will this station handle the grex pistol type airbrush?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't think so. The fork that holds it up at the end sets 2\/3rds~ of the way down my brush. It doesn't look like it will hold the pistol grip.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Another fllter question. What does it seem to be made of? Can a replacement be made out of other filter materials?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi Cory, I think the original filter was made of some kind of felt. I have been unable to find replacement filters for it so I went to Hobby Lobby in the art department and found a round yellow round sponge and cut it to size or you can use Compressed Facial Sponges -Natural Beige- Pack of 12 by Sponge Producers from Amazon work equally as well but you must wet them and squeeze them out before you cut them. The sponge from Hobby Lobby seemed a little pricy for just one sponge, but these facial cleaning sponges really work well and are completely disposable and even reusable if needed. They are also very reasonable in price. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this used with cosmetics as well? Can you use water in the station with water-based makeup?\n Answer:","completion":" It can be. I use it with acrylic paints which are water based and I always use keep water in it. This is a high quality product and I recommend it highly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I recently purchased this pot and everything seems fine but the lid says \"Sparmax\" on it. Is Iwata and Sparmax the same brand?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine has the same inscription, I assume Iwata has them made by them. In any case it works wonderfully and It's an item anyone who uses an airbrush will wonder why they didn't get one sooner, It makes painting so much easier not having to run off to rinse my brush out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is anyone using this with an Aztec airbrush?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know anything about Aztec airbrushes, but the images on Google indicate that they have a different shape than Iwata-type airbrushes. It appears to me that the Iwata-Media is probably not the best solution for you. However, you might check out the Testors Aztec Airbrush Cleaning Station - 9315.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will this work with a 3\" x 3\" stamp? Is it a true 3 1\/4\" wide? I'd like to use it to stamp pattern pieces for sewing - does it smudge for long?\n Answer:","completion":" I just measured our stamp pad. It is 2.5\" x 4\". We used it for our baby's foot print on paper. It smudged even on paper, and it took a long time to dry. Plus it was very hard to clean the ink off the skin. I hope this helps. We were not satisfied with this product, plus Amazon kept sending us the blue ink pad when the description and product we wanted was the black ink.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is this a good machine for a beginner?\n Answer:","completion":" I think so. I've only used one machine before this one and it was a really easy transition. This machine has a lot of options and settings, but they're easy to figure out. It just takes a read through of the manual and you should be good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i apply this over a finished sealer called FROG JUICE ?\n Answer:","completion":" SORRY NO KNOW\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this good for white pine floor 35 square ft\n Answer:","completion":" You'd need more than a gallon. I don't think this would work good for a floor. There are other materials more suited to that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Plan to use on an outside table - Gets half sun and half day of shade. Using over boards that are stained and Sikens coated. Only problems with that\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't expose this product to sunlight. Uv light breaks down most epoxies. You would have to strip it and recoat every year.

{"prompt":"Question: could I use this product to make a small cube in a silicone mold?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say yes. Just make sure they are equal parts and you have mixed it long enough. When your mixing tool starts to warm up, that is enough. Even mix it a little longer by a few minutes after that if you are keeping close \"watch\". If you think it had been warm for a minute or two, then I would say that is enough. Silicon is a very slippery substance. I believe you would have no problem getting it out when it is fully set. And it sets up nice and hard.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm having the same problem as others, it will not harden. I've used epoxy probably more than 100 times. 2nd coat on shuffleboard. What do I do now?\n Answer:","completion":" Scrape off the areas that are gooey and wet then mix again and re pour. I found that it really helped when I mixed it up on a scale so I had the same amount of both in weight. Had no problems after that. Also I was told by the company to mix well in a disposable container for exactly a minute then pour in a new container and mix for another whole minute with a new mixing stick. Throw both containers away after that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I want to cover an existing counter top, is there a trick to getting this on the vertical edge?\n Answer:","completion":" If you are doing it I world recommend putting a coat or two on the vertical edge first with a sponge brush and let it set up. When you do the counters make sure you flood the top so it can drop over the edge. Smooth the vertical edge with a brush or flat edge. When it has set up to a little past the tacky stage you can take a straight razor and cut off any drips on the underside of the edge. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many sq ft does one gallon do?\n Answer:","completion":" I found my instructions. They say: Layer is approx. 1\/16\" thick [4 oz. kit = 1 sq. foot] [8 oz. kit = 2 sq. feet] [Pint kit = 4 sq. feet] [Quart kit = 8 sq. feet] [1\/2 Galloon kit = 16 sq. feet] [Gallon kit = 32 sq. feet] NOTE: Be sure to follow the mixing instructions carefully to get good results.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm having difficulty removing the tip. Any suggestions other then pliers? I tried heating it up and cooling it off in the freezer too.\n Answer:","completion":" When cool, turn counter clockwise. It is hard to start. You could try using one of those jar opener grips to get a better hold on it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to cut stencils? Would it get too hot for stencils?\n Answer:","completion":" I think with the right attachment and care this would be great for cutting stencils but it's only a supposition because I haven't used this for cutting, yet. Thanks for the idea though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this on leather?\n Answer:","completion":" You may want to consider the Versa Tool as the temperature can be turned down. If you want to continue with the 5570 I would suggest practice on scarp material first so you can see how quickly it burns.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the pencil tip come with this set?\n Answer:","completion":" Not sure what exactly a pencil tip Is but there is a rounded tip I use to write with.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can this be used to etch\/burn bones or teeth?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure. It might, it might not. The way the nibs are ( to me ) seems like it wouldn't do the best, partially because it's a wood burner ( it works best on meltable\/porous material like wood\/plastic\/paper\/leather\/etc ) and partially because bones\/teeth are so hard\/solid. I feel like it'd only leave awkward marks or would require so much pressure that it'd put the bone matter at risk of shattering. Hope I helped!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this work for signing your name on wood?\n Answer:","completion":" It should, yes. Just make sure to follow the directions. It needs about 4-5 minutes to heat up ( don't touch the end bit at that time, it smarts ) and be careful about pressure. Too heavy, it'll scorch and make unsightly holes. Too light and it won't do much at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it stay hot enough to burn into the wood continuously as you go, or do you have to stop drawing at times to let it come back up to temp?\n Answer:","completion":" I would draw very slowly.. And it took a long time. I've never used another, so I figured it was normal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this hot enough for simple solder repairs?\n Answer:","completion":" I doubt it. It's hot enough for simple wood projects. Still trying to find wood easy to work with this tool. I just bought it to do a quick art study.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this burn a bamboo cutting board\n Answer:","completion":" I think it would. So far, I've only used it on pine. It heats up quickly. My major project is a clock--I just had to make up mind what I wanted on it! I'm going with a sun burned into the center.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the pages of heavy enough paper to hold cards, i.e. Christmas, Birthday etc.\n Answer:","completion":" It would depend on how very heavy they are. Regular cards, yes\n"}

What is the largest photo size that will fit in this album?\n Answer:","completion":" the pages measure 11 inches by 14 inches . there would be no room for edges on a 11 by 14 picture. so my answer is this is not for 11 by 14 pictures.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the pages simular to construction paper? And how are they binded-tied? That's really what I'm looking for.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they are. The pages are held by prongs. It's like an old fashioned scrap book.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: I would like scrapbook that has the buff colored pages to glue newspaper articles i it. Do not want the plastic pages. is this like that\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. This has the buff color pages. It is perfect for newspaper clippings\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many pages will it hold ?\n Answer:","completion":" It can hold at least 50, probably more, because it has the ability to expand by unscrewing the screws at the back and inserting the additional pages. I have one with silk and it is very attractive.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many pages front and back?\n Answer:","completion":" 50 paper pages- 1oo front and back- I bought plastic pages\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are they firm heads .. reason i am asking, have recently purchased weaker sponge brushes and ended up returning them . .\n Answer:","completion":" These are stiff enough to use with polyurethane or paint.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have rubber insert inside the foam to make it stiffer?\n Answer:","completion":" It has a plastic stiffener that goes to within 5\/16\" of the end of the brush\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be used in cold press soaps?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I have been using it for my soaps but it is hard to gauge how the color will end up looking in the end...kind of a fun surprise, I guess!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Which Cricut to get!?! Should I get the smaller cricut personal or the new cricut expression?\n Answer:","completion":" I would go with the Expression so you're not as limited with sizes. With the smaller one you can only cut up to 5\". I have had mine for about 4 months (I've never had one before this) and it is awesome! If you do as much paper crafting as you say, you'll be much happier with the larger one. Yes, it is bigger, but I think it's worth the extra space. Also there isn't a huge price difference between the two. (Do NOT buy one at your local craft store, go online!ohmycrafts.com, customcrops.com or ebay) You will find with the expression there are a lot of other things to do with it besides paper crafting, such as home decorating with the vinyl. You can also do mix 'n match, flip and center point which allows you to center an image and cut a shape around it. When I was looking to purchase one I had the same question you have, and I'm glad I went with the expression because I couldn't imagine being limited by the smaller one. Keep in mind if you do want the smaller one there are two versions: the personal and the create. The personal is the older model with less features, the create has the same features as the expression but the smaller size. But once again, I see no point in getting that one unless you are truly limited on space. The expression is not that heavy so if you had to move it it wouldn't be that big of a deal. Hope this helps!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: do I need an internet connection to use this? Or just a PC and added software? ANY kelp please..thanks....\n Answer:","completion":" No internet or PC is required for use. You just have to buy cartridges with designs on them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: wanting to make signs and plagues fot a craft booth I am renting, would this machine work for that type of thing? Do i need to order vinyl pages, can\n Answer:","completion":" If you have the Cri-cut Personal Electric Cutter and a font cartridge, you can cut large letters from cardstock and glue to posterboard. If you have the larger Cri-cut machine, you can cut using 12x12 inch cardstock and vinyl.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you design your own image, like a high school mascot?\n Answer:","completion":" Not on this machine. On the Cricut Explore you can.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can it be connected to a computer\n Answer:","completion":" no. mine can't.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the pieces pre stamped on the felt? I bought a stocking kit recently and the felt was not pre stamped.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes they are prestamped\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it wash well\n Answer:","completion":" I scotch guard my felt before I start, so far I've made about 30 stockings and 4 tree skirts. Some are several years old and still look clean I've never washed them. I'd be afraid the sequins would discolor. I also line the stocking for the added wear on the piece.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this genuine wool felt or is it acrylic craft felt?\n Answer:","completion":" I am not sure what type of felt it is but is IS NOT wool. I think if it was wool, the stocking would be too heavy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be washed and what will it look like after? also what type of felt does it come with?\n Answer:","completion":" The felt pieces in this kit were nice, a good quality and thickness. I would recomment hand washing if necessary, or just spot cleaning. If it is dusty - try a blast of canned air. I would not recommend a vigorous washing - unless you know your handiwork will stand up to it. I put easy-knit interfacing on the back of the front piece before putting the stocking together to kind of seal up and protect the threads that may be on the inside. (low heat, gently on a tick towel - kind of like blocking a sweater - just enough to fuse the interfacing). My daughter carried it around for two days after Christmas last year (she was 3) and then I just gave it a quick look over and made sure no spots, or loose decorations - put it in a 2.5 gal zipper bag and put in the cupboard.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: On the cuff, should I sew all the candy on first before applique it to the front of the stocking? It tells me to do the opposite. That seems harder.\n Answer:","completion":" I had a different stocking. I would probably do candy first.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: My kit didn't come with the first two pages of instructions. How can I get them?\n Answer:","completion":" I would look for a company number or contact number on the back of the packaging or inserts.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I let you know what name to embroider on te cupcake after purchase?\n Answer:","completion":" This is a kit. It comes in pieces and you will have to put it together and do all the embroidery yourself. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How far does the shaft extend out of the box?\n Answer:","completion":" 3\/4\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What size is the box?\n Answer:","completion":" 2 1\/8\" x 2 1\/8\" x 3\/4\" thick. (55 mm x 55 mm x 20 mm)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The product dimensions are shown as 6.9 X 3.8 X 2 inches, yet the box is 2 1\/8\" X 2 1\/8 x 5\/8 and the longest hand is a little over 3\". Does the 6.9\" dim include packing material, etc ? Thank you .\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure I fully understand the question but here's my best guess. I think the product dimension refers to the packaged product. It is mounted on a descriptive card with the product in a sealed plastic bubble. The box dimension refers to the plastic housing holding the clock movement and battery slot.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The hole in my clock is 5\/8\" deep. My question is: do I go for the 3\/4\" size or 1\/2\" size? I want it to reach, but not to flop around! Thanks :)\n Answer:","completion":" Use the 3\/4\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what does 3\/4\" refer to?\n Answer:","completion":" it refers to the length of the threaded part of the \"stem\" that holds the hands...how thick is the clock face? I used it to go through a piece of wood and this was the longest I could find and it worked pretty well. Hope that helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the tick noisy? Looking to buy this to replace parts for my son's clock that keeps him up at night it's so noisy.\n Answer:","completion":" It's not 100% silent but it's not irritatingly loud either. I have it in my family room over our big-screen t.v. so we hardly notice it. But if it's for a bedroom and your son is a very light sleeper, he may be able to hear it, but just barely. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what size battery?\n Answer:","completion":" One AA size battery.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how long is the threaded portion of the shaft?\n Answer:","completion":" 7\/8\"\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: for what size face would this be appropriate? I have a five inch wide space\n Answer:","completion":" I used it with a six inch clock face.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Will such a large spool fit on my Brother CS6000i sewing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, it will fit. However, like I stated in my review, sew slowly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the \"natural\" color dyed or undyed?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't know for sure, but since most cotton thread or anything else cotton is made from cottonseed I wouyld guess it would have to be dyed for the general market. See how many shades of white there are for example. Hope this is helpful.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: should there be have knots in cotton heavy duty?\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you for contacting Threadart. No, there should not be knots in the thread off the spool.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a 18\" x 200\" continuous roll? The 12 x 18 and 18 x 25 and 500 per ream descriptions are confusing me. It is listed as \"Pacon White Easel Roll, 18 X 200 Feet, White, (4763) by Pacon (Jan 1, 2010)\" when I search Amazon for \"butcher paper.\" Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" The description now is different from when I purchased it in 2009. But it was a continuous roll of 18 inches by 200 feet.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It is July, 2014. Is this 18\" x 200' roll of white paper still available for purchase? One reviewer sez it is not. Please advise.\n Answer:","completion":" yes these are still available.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hello owners, is this still a continuous roll of 18\" (inches) by 200' (feet)?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it perforated?\n Answer:","completion":" No. But I just cut several sheets each time so I have some ready to go.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: from the description, this should be 500 separate sheets of paper. is this correct? from the other questions\/answers, it's confusing!\n Answer:","completion":" That's odd. It's a roll or paper, not sheets like in the picture.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Daisy Girl Scout troop (K and 1st graders) who need to do several group art projects to earn their 'petals'. Is this paper sturdy enough?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I think so.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this in roll form or continuous folded and stacked like the picture shows?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not know what in the world is up with that picture because mine was as the description, in a roll, not folded like that picture. Good luck. Probably the picture is wrong, though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you know the diameter of the roll? trying to fit on the land of nod wall paper holder. thx\n Answer:","completion":" this no longer matches what I ordered years ago (my order was for sheets of paper. what I received did not match what was advertised, so be careful). Sorry I can't help.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this on a standing floor easel? Thanks.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes; works for my children.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'm looking for protective paper for my heat press. Does this paper have wax? I can't use anything that is recycled or that has wax.\n Answer:","completion":" No, it doesn't have wax. My kids use both sides for coloring and it's the same on front and back\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I order 3 yards of this fabric will it come 3 yards uncut or 3- 1 yard increments? The description is confusing me.\n Answer:","completion":" I bought 44 \" and IT came in one piece.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it come in one long piece if bought more than one yard, or does it come in singular squares? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" It comes in one long piece - but you should ask the vendor. Very nice quality.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i this material good for a tablecloth?\n Answer:","completion":" I wouldn't use it for a table cloth because it is so thin. It probably has a lot of sizing in it to give it the body it does have. I used it for curtains for a college dorm room and lined it with a white cotton fabric of similar weight because I wanted an inexpensive fabric that only need to last a couple of years and would not need to be washed. It worked well for that use. If the fabric is not substantial enough to wear, it would not be substantial enough for a table cloth that must be washed from time to time. Hope this is helpful to you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, is this product like T-shirt fabric? that is what i am looking for\n Answer:","completion":" no it is more like a duck cloth- stiff not at all like t shirt material\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would it work for upholesrtering a headbaord\n Answer:","completion":" No, this is very light and fine material. It is good for lightweight men's shirts, maybe even lightweight cotton semi sheer curtains, but not for a headboard. Might be good for a cotton lining in a women's jacket. I sure hope this helps out Linda.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the width?\n Answer:","completion":" 60 inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: If I order 4 of these, will it be four 1-yard lengths, or one 4-yard length?\n Answer:","completion":" One 4 yard length. I ordered 2 and that's how it came...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you put it right onto the window or do you have to sew it onto curtains? If yes, how?\n Answer:","completion":" We used a cable curtain rod (sold through Amazon). (Look it up on Amazon's site.) My wife simply hemmed the material top and bottom, after sewing the panels together to create enough length. It all fits nicely behind our exesting drapes. This proved an excellent solution for our southern exposure room.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it good for make a DIY projector screen?\n Answer:","completion":" wow, i never thought about using it for something like that. i suppose it would work. although the fabric is ivory colored on one side and white on the other. between the two sides you should be able to find which works best, unless you want to get a white roc-lon fabric to be sure, i think they make that. it smells a lttle chemically, i put mine on the clothes line for an hour or so before making the drapes to get rid of the strong smell. you might want to do that before putting it in a family room or other small space.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this fabric be machine wash?\n Answer:","completion":" I washed (after sewing it) on the laundromat (didn't use the dryer) and it came out perfectly fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have a latex backing? can it be dry cleaned?\n Answer:","completion":" I have actually thrown mine in the washer a few times. It came out softer which isn't a bad thing depending in how you hang it sometimes not being so stiff makes it hang better\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need 6 panels of 121 inches in length and 35 inches in width. How much material do I need?\n Answer:","completion":" This is what the posting for the lining said: Blackout Drapery Lining This fabric is sold by the yard and cut to order. The dimensions of this fabric are 54'' in width, by the number of yards you order in length. For example, if you order 3 yards, your fabric will measure 54'' x 108''. If you need a continuous length of over 15 yards, please contact us to be sure we can accommodate your request. Therefore, since you need something in 35\" in width and the seller only sells the fabric in 54\"W... You will need to tell the seller you need 6 panels of 54\"W X 121\"L and then you will have to cut it to your desired width of 35\". I recommend you go to a JoAnn Fabrics or something and see if they will help you with the cutting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the best way to attach this liner to already existing curtains?\n Answer:","completion":" I just cut it to the same size as curtain panel and then sewed it to the back of the panel. To make it less obvious, I sewed it along the seam that was already on the original curtain.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the Blackout, or the Budget Blackout (lighter weight)? See: roc-lon.com\/products\/3pass_blackout_l...\n Answer:","completion":" This is the only blackout material I purchase so it's impossible for me to compare. Heavyweight, almost velvety feel to the touch. This fabric works better than any room darkening store bought drape.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would like to use this with my motor home windshield curtains that measure 180x38 inches, how much would I need of the 54 in. wide roc -lon\n Answer:","completion":" You'll have to run it lengthwise so order how many inches you need; if they will be attached without following any folds just add seam allowance. I put a backing of this on some curtains and they bulked them up, made them harder to handle and showed. Frankly I ended with new ones out of a great blackout with pretty fabric look in many colors that's just as blackout but lighter weight called Zanzibar. Or try blackout roller shades for RVs? This stuff is hard to work with.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the length of the white chenille fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" It is sold by the yard, so you can order what you need. I personally got 2 yards.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this 100% Cotton Fabric\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it shed in the wash and is it too fuzzy for a pillow to sleep on?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine didn't shed too badly in the wash- but I also have a brand new HE machine. I think it might be a little annoying for the top of a pillow, but it would be nice for a backside and a softer flatter fabric on the front. Overall this is a really nice Chenille for the price. It's worth getting just to try.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: This is the same as the \"European 100% Linen Oatmeal\" on Fabric.com? (@ $14\/yard?)\n Answer:","completion":" Each manufacturer makes slightly different fabric. Linen seems to be the most diverse in that each fabric is a little different and there are so many choices . Since you are asking, you probably have a need for a certain feel or strength. Ask for a sample. Sometimes you get them free in a store,but on line you pay a small amount. If you can reach someone by phone , tell them your purpose and then get samples of what they suggest before you buy. This is the hardest part if sewing but it's worth the energy and time to choose the fabric you'll like\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Is there a difference between pastel pencils and pastel chalk pencils?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not sure -the stabilo pencils are more chalky than traditional pastels which tend to be more oily, I love these because they smudge and blend if you brush a little water over them, the colors are really vibrant and I've enjoyed them.

{"prompt":"Question: Why doesn't the Cricut Craft Room work with the iMac computer?\n Answer:","completion":" The answer PROVO craft gave me was that Apple only works with approved Apple software. I assume that means PROVO has not paid what ever fees Apple requires for approval. Even though PROVO says that CCR is mac compatible, it is only compatible with older versions of the Operating System. Once you update your Operating System to 10.9.2 (I think that is the version), CCR is no longer compatible. They have told me for 4 months now that they are working on the problem and have no estimate on when\/if they will find a solution. In the interim, they suggested I get a PC. When CCR works, it is fantastic. At this point, I am not impressed with Provo.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Vinyl\/Rubber? Has anyone tried cutting thick vinyl or rubber with the Cricut?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes! There are rubber sheets available for stamps etc, there is also a \"thick material\" cutting blade as well for the cricut. There is a new program out that allows you to cut any font or design using your cricut which means you would never need to buy another of the expensive cartridges. I design files for it and you can find them at http:\/\/www.scrapbookcutters.com the information about the program can be found on my blog. I also own a yahoo group where you can get tons of information too. http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/group\/CriCut\/\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you cut material for quilting such as squares ?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use open type or true type fonts with my expression\n Answer:","completion":" No. You can only use the fonts that are contained on the individual cartridge you purchase. If you want to use type or true type then you should get a Silhouette, not a Cricut.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how does the Cricut Craft Room work with the original Expression Cutting Machine?\n Answer:","completion":" I love the craft room. You download the program free from cricut.com. Then you can use physical cartridges or digital ones to create projects and view before cutting them. You can also save projects for future use also.

It should also come with a weight sleeve, metal rod weights, a couple of clips and some elastic thread.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you make socks with this machine?\n Answer:","completion":" I would not make socks with this, but I'm sure you could. I've seen many reviews from people that were not able to use the machine but it takes patience to learn and a lot of practice. I wouldn't really call this a machine, it's more like a loom, you are still doing all the work. I've made blankets, bags, sweaters and cowl\/scarfs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this device electric does it come with wax too\n Answer:","completion":" No, it does not use electricity. Yes, it should come with wax.\n"}

The only round one that has 48 pegs is the purple 10.25\" loom. It has a slightly smaller gauge than the others, which will mean that your afghan will have a little finer stitch. It did not come in the kit; I had to order it and the yellow 41 peg 11.50\" loom separately. I wanted large and extra-large adult hat sizes. Hope this helps you out. Patricia\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this the same yellow loom that's packaged in the four round loom set?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, sometimes they are different colors but same size.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many pegs are in this loom? 41 pegs?\n Answer:","completion":" 41pegs\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: What is the size?\n Answer:","completion":" It's 41 pegs 11 1\/2 inches in diameter\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you have any 50 peg round looms?\n Answer:","completion":" For that you might want Knittingboard's all-in-one loom. The spacing is 6\/16\", but you could skip every other peg and get 6\/8\", with 48 pegs used maybe more with the sliders. Plus you can make socks on it and many other things.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does counter lock\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. There's a lock on the bottom left side. It's that white lever in the picture.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How do I turn it back to zero?\n Answer:","completion":" On the right and left side you see a white piece of plastic sticking out in a slot...you cannot go back...just push up on either the right side or left side...once you get to 9, push the button once more and it will go back to zero.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with a cord? Its false advertising to show a cord if its not in the package. I was very dissapointed to find out that it does not come with a cord .Its over priced not to have a cord come with it.\n Answer:","completion":" The package clearly states \"Neck cord not included ....\" so it should come as no surprise to find there is no cord. The picture merely shows how some knitters use it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this suitable for someone who crochets? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" This is absolutely suitable for crochet. I both knit and crochet and find this very helpful in keeping track of rows.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it make noise when you click it? I need a quiet counter.\n Answer:","completion":" It's minimal. It's not loud enough that I notice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this \"mini\" counter differ from the one I pay $10.50 for?\n Answer:","completion":" Did not order this. I ordered heart puff ball maker that did not work and for some reason the review shows up on this. If it works like the pompom maker it is no good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: It only appears to be able to go to 99. What happens if you continue? will it go 99, 00, 01, 02, etc?\n Answer:","completion":" Exactly, works great and easy. Either hang from neck or set to side.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What does this have to do with making pom poms? Reviews confuse me on the use\n Answer:","completion":" Most likely counting the number of times you wind the strand of yarn around the pom-pom gadget.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how exactly does it work?\n Answer:","completion":" Each time you finish a row, or whatever you are counting, you press down on the large white button under the finger in the picture. This will advance the counter by one. When you take a break, you move the little white tab (bottom left in photo) and that locks the counter so it does not advance in error. When you are finished your counting and want to start over at zero, unlock the counter, and roll the little wheels (either side) to bring the numbers back to zero. It's very simple in design but works beautifully.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I'd also like to know what sizes are included! It should say in the description!\n Answer:","completion":" 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10.5, 11, 13, 15\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do the cable couplers let you make a circular needle longer than 36 inches?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. My set has one each 12,14,16,21 inch cables and 2 connectors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the function of the small black circular pad that is included in the set?\n Answer:","completion":" The black pad and the wire with the loop in the end are used to tighten\/loosen the tips. The tip is held with the black pad (which works like a jar-opening gripper) and the wire is inserted through the hole in the connector on the cord. Applying pressure to the wire torques the tip tight so that it doesn't come loose. The pad and wire are also needed to remove the tip, since if they were properly tightened they cannot be loosened by hand.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Needlemaster 40-Piece Interchangeable Aluminum Knitting Set description says, 8 Sets of aluminum single-point needles. How many needles are there?\n Answer:","completion":" 13 sets\n"}

(similar to this: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/lspx29l )\n Answer:","completion":" Actually yes, they do. They're not on the needles themselves but rather on the extension loops.

{"prompt":"Question: Are the cables really flexible or is it that same, nasty, twisted plastic they've been using for years?\n Answer:","completion":" They're a little softer, but still not as soft as addi needles. Also, because the joins are now straight, the rigidity is not a problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: where can I find other cable lengths for this kit? I have a pattern calling for a 40CM (16 in) circular needled and this kit only goes down to 20 inch\n Answer:","completion":" You should be able to find just the individual cables online (I saw some on Amazon) or at Hobby Lobby. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Boye-NeedleMaster-Cables-16\/dp\/B001683XKE\/ref=sr_1_1?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1386549585&sr=1-1&keywords=boye+cables\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: It is just for to make sweaters or I can make anything else on it? eg : ponchos\n Answer:","completion":" If you found a pattern you can increase and decrease on it. So you can make blankets, scarves, sweaters, hats, etc.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will smooth, 100% cotton yarn work on this machine, or does the yarn need to have some stretch?\n Answer:","completion":" Shouldn't have any problem with 100% cotton. It has more problems if the yarn is too large or too small of a weight.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is silicon spray absolutely needed?\n Answer:","completion":" I have used mine off and on for 8 months and have never used it or felt like I needed to.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you make your own weights for the knitting?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, buy cheap metal forks at the dollar store and bend the tines over with pliers or in a vice. Then tape fishing weights to the forks and hang. It's a cheap solution and works very well.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Do the Knifty Knitter loom clips fit this size of loom?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. But all the clips I've ever gotten are a really difficult fit with this loom and any other looms I've tried to hook them on. So if I were you I would buy 2 sets of clips\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Can you put items slightly thicker than paper through it? Such as a thin fabric or ribbon?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not know for sure about the ribbon but I do not see any reason why you couldn't put thicker paper through it. It is very possible that ribbon would work if it wasn't really thick. I have had one of these for 10 years or more. The first just broke after about 10 years.\n"}

I hope that helps?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the paper that you put in come out with a \"lamination\" type feel or just a paper feel?\n Answer:","completion":" They have different cartridges for different machines.

Just sprinkle on the sticky side and then run it back through again on the other side.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how weather resistant are the stickers?what about the adhesive?\n Answer:","completion":" I have had no problem with stickiness in any weather. However, the material used on top (paper, vinyl, etc.) can be affected by the weather. For example, I would not want to cut a figure from paper and make it sticky on the back and then get the paper part wet. Protect your stickers just as you would protect anything made from the same material. Vinyl would probably fare better than paper.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: what size letters. can I just touch the stones in white paint and put the letter where I want?\n Answer:","completion":" The square is 1\", but the letters are smaller. There are only 20 squares in the package, meaning there are letters and punctuation on both sides of each square. Im not sure what you mean about the white paint, the letters are merely to leave an imprint and are designed to be reused. They worked well for me I make my doggie headstones with the letters and designed with decorative stones jewels and used my dog's paw to leave a print. I hope this helps.

How can you have 26 letters and 10 numerals represented with only 20 stamps? Are some letters\/numerals left out?\n Answer:","completion":" what they probably dont tell you is that there are letters or character on both sides of each stamp. It isnt inconvenient unless you are wanting to place all the letters you need side by side at the same time. Otherwise you are limited to pressing only one letter or character at a time, I use it for concrete and mortar. It contains a good selection of characters, but only capitol letters. I am pleased with the function durability of this very inexpensive product.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I need to know what size the letters will be. Please let me know. I am looking for 5\/8 inch letters???\n Answer:","completion":" Not real sure but if they have the larger size please purchase those. These small letter the concrete is wet then tends to close up. Does not make for a pretty keepsake like I wanted. Also, finding the letter is a nightmare the way they have them. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi, Would this applicator be suitable for tube lined designs on pottery?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say no, because the tip might clog up too quickly. I don't even get white glue through because it is too thick. There are other bottles out there that have plastic tips you can cut that might suit you better, and they are also cheaper. - I just looked and they claim you can put paint in, but these caps only push, not screw on, and I would not trust them with paint. Once the nozzle clogs it's done.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: tackle box\n Answer:","completion":" I am unsure what you are asking in terms of \"tackle box\", so allow me to assume the following: If you are asking if you could use this as a tackle box you carry around, the answer is, \"No\". The picture is of three different items. Item one is the outer white cube. It is made of VERY heavy pressed wood fiber with arrangeble rails to support 6 Super Slim ArtBin Boxes or 3 Larger Super Boxes. The boxes are available in many different depths and configurations. All sold individually. So, you could not take it out fishing with you like a tackle box. However; having said that, if you are a SERIOUS fisherman, and needed a home storage facility for a large collection of different flies, weights, hooks, lines, float etc... The ArtBin system you see would be a Great organizer for your collection. You can buy wheels that are easily attached to one Cube and you can stack three or more high (there are supplies included with the cube to allow the attachment of another box on top of the one you buy. I have 2 sets of 3 cubes stacked on top of one another creating two towers. A set of wheels on the bottom cube allow me to move them around. I use mine to organize my craft collection items. Cake decorating tips, Circuit scrape booking cartridges, Creative Memories, calligraphy pens and tips, etc... Hope this information helps you. CLBH\n"}

I have limited space and would like to fit two sets of cubes side by side in a small space,\n Answer:","completion":" Made of pressed wood. Very sturdy and slide artbin boxes great. No other brand though. Has to have a lip on the lid. Not sure on measurement of the sides.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How tall are the small and large bins?\n Answer:","completion":" Please check the internet for specific dimensions, as I don't know those off the top of my head. I will say that the Super Satchel does not fit into the bin cube, so be aware of that, prior to ordering.\n"}

It is only one spot on the package where it mentions that. On the package where it does say that...it is listing the different methods for the different types of films.

{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference between the regular Stitch Witchery and the \"super\"?\n Answer:","completion":" The difference between the Regular and the Super Stitch Witchery is that the super will give more bonding power to the fabric since it's a bit more dense in texture! For example, wool or any type of heaver fabric will bond to it self a bit better using the Super Stitch Witchery, on the other hand silk or any lighter type of fabric will bond to itself just fine with Regular Stitch Witchery. But please don't for get that the ultimately bonding out come will be in the ironing process! So please follow the information given on the instruction panel of the wrapper! Because weather you purchase Regular or Super if you don't gauge your iron to the satisfactory temperature then the fuse tape might not melt well! and this can leave you with your project not being properly fused together. Hope this helps.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Once it is bonded can it be taken off or reversed?\n Answer:","completion":" I'm not certain, as I haven't tried but i can't imagine it would be to difficult to remove.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would this be good to lace a walking stick handle?\n Answer:","completion":" I think the diameter of the cord is too narrow to be the best choice for a walking stick. To give you a comparison, it's thinner than a wooden toothpick.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this size (2mm round) work for stringing 6x9mm pony beads?\n Answer:","completion":" You need to measure the hole in the beads to know. This leather is 2 mm in diameter. If the bead holes are greater than 2mm, this will work. If not, it will not work without having to enlarge the bead holes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Would this product hold a gourd bird house?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it would. I use it to make jewelry. It is extremely strong.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it normal to have tiny \"chunks\" of stuff in the cream? I had a little trouble applying it 'cause I had to keep picking out the tiny pieces.\n Answer:","completion":" The longer it's exposed to air, the more chunks it gets. And the bigger. I just apply anyway, and try to make sure there is good liquid under the chunks, and then wipe it away with a rolling motion to keep the chunks from damaging my stencils. It's a pain, but I haven't found a solution. I did try to filter it, but it was messy and didn't really help much. Good luck. :)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the shelf life after it has been opened?\n Answer:","completion":" I have never had a jar go bad. It is reusable. Spread it on to etch and then scrape it right back in the jar. Not sure what happened to mine. Maybe it had been frozen - I have no idea how it got the chunks. Even tried pushing it through a strainer. Just make sure your jar has a seal on top before you buy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: There have been varying answers as to how long to leave the product on the item and how thick to apply it.. Help!\n Answer:","completion":" It will have to be a trial and error process I'm sure. I put on two thin coats and let it sit for twenty minutes. Then I rinse it off and do it a second time the same way. Sometimes, depending on the type of glass, I may have to apply a third time (but this is very rare). I like a heavier etch, however. For a light etch, one time is plenty.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have sliding glass doors that I want to etch, but the product description says \"NOT recommended for etching large solid areas of glass.\" Why?\n Answer:","completion":" It takes a lot of practice to get an even uniform etch even on small items. It would likely be blotchy and\/or streaky without LOTS of practice.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many last names would this put on glass cake pans? Would it do 20 different pans?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it would, we put names on 26 mugs for my wedding, and 20 for another wedding and we still have over half the container remaining.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would this product work to etch pieces of colored glass? I want to turn sharp fragments into dull, ground, beach-washed pieces. How long to soak?\n Answer:","completion":" It should work on colored glass as well as clear. The instruction say to only leave it on for 1 minute then wash off with water. Usually takes at least that long to even brush it on. I've had very good luck with etching initials and designs on cheap wine glasses and it gives a very nice translucent frosted effect, just like \"sea glass\". Hope this helps. Oh, apply a rather thick coat.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will it etch porcelain bathtub for painting?\n Answer:","completion":" Never heard of using it for that but I really doubt it for things I have used it for...it does ok on glass..very watery and I wouldn't think it would work...I may be wrong..\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will this product work to etch the porcelain on my tub in preparation for refinishing?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't believe so.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these the blades for the new Cricut Explore?\n Answer:","completion":" I called cricut to answer you correctly, because my first thought was yes..and every time I googled explore replacement blade this one popped up, she said you can use them but cuts won't be the same since the angle on this blade is different than the carbide blade on the explore. They are waiting on the replacement blades for the explore she said. So none in stock. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does the cricut explore use the same replacement blades\n Answer:","completion":" No it doesn't, I called Provo craft and they said that it's a special blade and they were waiting to get them in. Maybe they have them now.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I know it says all Cricut machines, but will these work on the Cricut Mini?\n Answer:","completion":" yes I have the mini and two big machines it works with all 3\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Are these for the original Cricut?\n Answer:","completion":" I have the Cricut Expression so I am not sure! I buy a lot of blades however and I have never noticed that they ask that question. Can't speak for the Explorer but my daughter has the basic & we have bought the same blades together!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these blades for the Mini? the information on Cricut products falls short of complete....\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a Cricut Create, the original and it says to use the red top blades. Will these work as well\n Answer:","completion":" I have the original Cricut Expression and I use all the blades, including deep cut but not the ones for Cricut Cake. I'm not sure about Cricut Create. To be sure, call Cricut at 801-932-1144 Opt 7.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How do I know if these blades will fit my Cricut Expression? I do not have the original packaging, so am not sure if the 29-0002 is the right blade.\n Answer:","completion":" Honestly I just looked up my specific model number of my cricut and looked for what my blades looked like and went with it. And they were the right thing. I also knew if they were wrong I could just return them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this work with the expression 2?\n Answer:","completion":" They wwork universally\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this resin?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes this is an epoxy resin. It's mostly used for doming bezels in jewelry making as well as in small molds to create cabochons to be set into jewelry settings. It uses a 1:1 ratio and is easy to use and has almost no odor. Takes about 24-48 hours to cure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you use any kind of dye to add color or just resin dye\n Answer:","completion":" i actually use acrylic paint! i'd recommend looking up resin coloring tutorials online\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does this stay clear when dry\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does! I was so happy with the results that I didn't even put colored backing on some of my charms. :) Hope this helped.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a complete kit with the catalyst? I had to ask this for similar products since no package contents are shown or described.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the epoxy, once cured and hardened, safe for use on skin?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, but I can't imagine what you'd be using it for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a good amount to encapsulate a medium sized Emperor Scorpion?\n Answer:","completion":" I do believe it would. It comes with (2) 4 ounce bottles for a total of 8 ounces worth of epoxy. Look at your mold specs to get the capacity of the mold and subtract some for the bug - which could be substantial, in your case. I made (2) 4 ounce molds and still have some left over. If your Emperor is valuable to you, I suggest you do a test run first (with another bug) to see if you like the results before you try it with your Emperor.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What kinds of materials can you use for the mold? Does it have to be a special mold from a company like Castin' Cast, or can you use items around the\n Answer:","completion":" I typically use this inside of bottle charms but I have put them in silicon molds and they pop out very easily and shape beautifully to the detail\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to make end caps for a pen I can't get parts for. Could I color this with ink? Would it be durable enough to not scratch\/ chip afterwards?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are graduated cups and stir sticks included in this kit?\n Answer:","completion":" No they are not included.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is it weather proof?\n Answer:","completion":" Do you mean once the stuff hardens? If so, then yes. The hardened resin will resist moisture like plastic would.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use these mats with cricut explore\n Answer:","completion":" I have an Explore and it works fine with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i bought this and it says can be used with cricut expression 1 is that true? i cant figure out how to change the size on the craft room\n Answer:","completion":" I'm sorry, I won't be of much help because I don't have a cricut expression1 machine, so it would not be fair for me to try to answer something that I did not try out. I can tell you that this size is too big for my machine, so I just cut it to fit and it works fine. Good luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this work with the Cricut Imagine?\n Answer:","completion":" She has the Cricut Expression, You should have specs with the machine to let you know if you can handle the size. I just looked up your machine and it does say 12 in x 24 in cutting capability. Sorry but I looked up the wrong machine. All I can find on your machine is 12 x 12. Sorry for misinformation.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this with the brother scan and cut?\n Answer:","completion":" I do not know if it will work. Sorry\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do these come with a non stick cover sheet?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to use these on a small kitchen cabinet. Do they really support the 225 pounds?\n Answer:","completion":" I believe they probably would, I used them on a 30 lb or so 'nightstand' that I placed a large mini fridge on, stocked weight was probably70-80 lbs and no probs, they are pretty robust, if your going to push the envelope over 200 lbs you may want a second set and place two in the center if it's a wide span anyways, if not a large span 4 outghta do\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Size? ..I am replacing a broken caster. They need to match. The existing casters are: Wheel itself 1 1\/2\" +\/or Mounting plate to bottom of wheel is 2\"\n Answer:","completion":" Wheel itself is 2 inches. Good luck with your project.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the measurement of the square plate?\n Answer:","completion":" The plate is s little smaller than 1 1\/2 inches on each side.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do they swivel or rotate all the way around...I am wanting them for a suitcase\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, they swivel\/rotate-there is no lock on them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do they come with screws?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, they do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do these casters have a lock?\n Answer:","completion":" The casters I received did not have locks. Also, when I stacked two ArtBin cubes together (securing with the dowel sticks as recommended by the manufacturer) and installed the casters, the unit was unstable on carpeted floors. It is fine on hard floors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the width and length of the mounting plate on these four casters? Also are screws included in the purchase?\n Answer:","completion":" The mounting plate is square. They are 1 and 1\/2 inches on each side.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the diameter of the caster wheel?\n Answer:","completion":" The caster wheels are 1 3\/8 inches or 3 1\/2 centimeters. (Each wheel is 2 inches (5.1 cm long) and freely rotates). Each mount is 3.5 cm square and has four screws.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: How many actual page protectors come in the memory book I am wondering if it is 10 which equals 20 pages or if it is 20 page protectors equaling 40\n Answer:","completion":" 20 pages equalling 40\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How are the photos adhered to the pages? Can one use photo corners to place the pictures in the book? Are there pockets or plastic on the pages?\n Answer:","completion":" The pages don't have any pockets that could allow you to place the photos by themselves, you should use photo corners, auto mounts, permanent scrapbooking tape, glue sticks, glue dots, self adhesive squares, or any other method you normally use with photos. Each page has a plastic protector.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many pages does the book come with? And what kind? And about how many pages can it hold? I'm looking for something that holds about 175 pages.\n Answer:","completion":" It comes with 20 pages (as stated in description). I purchased additional page protectors and scrapbook paper and I'm up to 50 pages in my book\/box. I still have room for a few more pages. Depending what you put in scrapbook may determine how many pages you can place (i.e. thick decals\/ stickers). IMO the max. number of pages would be about 50 or so. IMO the way the book\/box is constructed is perfect for my needs keepinh everything neat and tidy. Beacuse its a \"3 ring\" its so easy to add more pages. I've already purchased another for future scrap booking.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: So this is an actual 3 ring binder where I can take out pages and insert more pages without taking the whole album apart?.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it is. Just so you know tho, it doesn't really come with a ton of pages. It is a really nice album all over tho.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the ribbon pictured in the photo attached to the photo album\/can it be removed?\n Answer:","completion":" The ribbons, two of them are to tie the top to the bottom. If you were to drop the album, the contents are safe from being damaged or falling out of the album. I love all 10 that I have and plan on getting a few more. After you see how neat all the album pages are kept, you will fall in love with them and never want any other type of album.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many pages does it hold?\n Answer:","completion":" I've put at least 30 sleeves in one so far.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there 12 x 12 pages with 4x6 pockets (divided pages where you can insert pictures and not have to scrapbook every page) that fit these well?\n Answer:","completion":" This album comes with 12x12 open pocket pages to put one (or two, back to back, depending on how much embellishments are added to each sheet) 12x12 inch piece of scrapbook paper into it that has been decorated and photos attached to it. But you can buy the 12 x 12 pages that have pockets for 4x6 photos and smaller pockets for journaling cards if you don't want to fool with scrapbooking and just want to use it as a photo album. It's versatile. You can purchase these pages here on Amazon or buy them at Walmart. I just picked up two packs at Walmart that have 10 pages each for under $3. Be sure they're the 3-ring pages and not the post-bound ones. A lot more can fit in this album than in those post-bound ones. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how many pages are there and how many pages can be inserted and of which color are the pages\n Answer:","completion":" There are 20 page protector inserts, so if you use both sides it equals 40 pages. The page insert that come with are just plain white.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is there a place to write information about the photo, beside the photo?\n Answer:","completion":" It's a scrapbook binder. You can create page any way you would like.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How wide is the spine?\n Answer:","completion":" This is like a 3\" 3 ring binder \/ box. It's really very cool ! You can put in all your pages with pictures, and trinkets and the thickness isn't too much. I even had room to put small memorabilia items in the back and ribbon close it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: For this specific product (4-inch by 180-inch) how many half-masks would I be able to make out of it?\n Answer:","completion":" Each package makes approximately one and a half masks (for adult men).\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many adult face masks can I make from this pkg of Activa Rigid plaster cloth 4-inch by 180 inch?\n Answer:","completion":" One\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How long does it take to dry enough to remove from what you are casting?\n Answer:","completion":" I would say 15-20 min. When I used this to make masks we quickly dipped the piece of gauze in water and I ran it between two fingers to shed most of the water. We then applied it to the face. I would say I had about 6 layers and I let it set for 20 min. then gently removed. Also when we did this we applied a grease to the face.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many inches are there between the needle and the arm? I want to move to larger projects so I'm looking for machine with a good amount of space in the neck for free motion quilting maybe a king size quilt. Thank you in advance!\n Answer:","completion":" There is 7 inches. I think this is about an average size, as my old Singer was the same\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the difference in the this \"limited Edition\" and the non \"limited edition\"? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" I don't believe there is one. The PRW designation is for the Project Runway tie-in. This machine was \"limited edition\" but still available at inflated prices over and above what it originally sold for.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this machine have free handed quilting capabilities\n Answer:","completion":" If you mean free-motion quilting, then yes, it does. There is a switch to lower the feed dogs, and the manual has instructions included. I can't say how well it works, though; I own a Juki TL-98Q that I have used for quilting for several years, and it is a much heavier-duty machine. It only does straight stitch, though, so the Brother is better for piecework with fancy stitching.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is this a free arm that can sew cuffs and narrow pant legs?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, there is a front panel that slips off to allow for freearm sewing. Very user friendly machine\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Dos it have automatic threader?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does, a little contraption on the side, which pokes the thread through the needle\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what else what i need to purchase along with this sewing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" just add thread and you're ready to go!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: i dont know anything about hemming, sewing machines etc. can this machine be used for hemming jeans also? is it heavy duty?\n Answer:","completion":" I hem jeans on it, but have to force it through the thick parts. And if the side seams at the hem are too thick, I have to leave that part open. That being said, I'd say it's pretty good all around, but if you're mainly hemming jeans, you might look elsewhere.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can this machine do embroidery\n Answer:","completion":" Decorative stitches, yes, embroidery, no.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: the auto threather is broken. can I order the part and have it pt in?\n Answer:","completion":" I've not had that problem. I would probably do a search online for parts. However, something tells me that you would probably do best to take it to a repair shop.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you embroider with this machine\n Answer:","completion":" Probably not...........only the decorative stitches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: To someone who has had the machine for over two year: do you still like it? Are the computer components working properly?\n Answer:","completion":" I have had my machine for two years this month, and still like it! I generally sew mid-weight fabrics (clothing alternations, bags\/purses) and it's going strong. Struggles a bit with thick layers like seams on denim, and sometimes very lightweight fabrics get tangled, but work slow and it's fine. I don't use a lot of the decorative stitch options, but everything seems to be in good working order.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is the throat size of this machine? Thanks!\n Answer:","completion":" From the needle point to the inside of the neck is 7 and 1\/2 inches and the height is 4 and 3\/4 inches\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I will use this machine primarily for piecing quilt tops and simple machine quilting. Any quilters opinions on this machine?\n Answer:","completion":" This Brother should work great for all your basic & even intermediate sewing needs. I quilt regularly with it, just make sure you use a quilting foot & an appropriate needle for your materials.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this machine have a blanket stitch for aplique?\n Answer:","completion":" It does have a blanket stitch. I've never used it for appliques myself though. But it does have one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you do free motion quilting with this model\n Answer:","completion":" I do free motion quilting with my machine. The tension must be adjusted: I use 7 or 8. For regular stitching a 4 or 5 tension works fine. If the tension isn't adjusted, I get eye-lashing on the back of the quilt if I'm doing circles and tight curves. I always make a sample quilt sandwich of each project to test the tension. I use a SewSlip glide sheet over the stitch plate to help move things evenly.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I quilt with this machine?\n Answer:","completion":" That is mainly what I do with mine. I piece blocks and also drop the feeds and free motion quilt.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What machine do I need? I want to hem heavy denim jeans and hem stretchy tops using a stretch stitch that won't break when pulled on.\n Answer:","completion":" I've sewn through 4 layers of denim using the appropriate needle for heavy fabrics. The machine can handle up to 15\/64\" thickness of material. For stretch fabrics, there is a particular needle and stitch patterns for stretch and elastic sewing.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is the default needle position (when you stop) up or down?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a brother machine, you can change the default needle position to whichever you like, check your manual. Mine is not as fancy as this one, in fact that is why I am here - contemplating purchasing this machine, but on my hc185 you can change the needle position, so I would assume you can on this model as well\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am torn between purchasing the PC420PRW or the SE425..I'll be doing more sewing than embroidering..would I benefit enough to get the SE425?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't do machine embroidery so I can't help with that. I can only say I have been very impressed with the quality of the Brother machines. I now have three - serger, the pc400prw and the pq1500s. Great machines\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the automatic cutter cuts the thread close to the fabric or does it leave tail?\n Answer:","completion":" It cuts close to the fabric. There aren't dangling threads left. I think it does a great job, and I use it all the time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you make shawls with the addi original express?\n Answer:","completion":" Not only can you make shawls it also makes sweaters. Just buy the addi express king size has a book by addi and it has several patterns.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am trying to decide on which addi machine to buy. I mainly want it for scarf making. Which one should I buy?\n Answer:","completion":" The little one is fine for scarfs but I'd get the king. It's far more useful. Don't waste money on the little one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi does free shipping apply to New Zealand? I wanted to purchase but was going to be charged an extra $30 for shipping? Thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Hello We will ship to New Zealand. Please check it now.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How easily does it handle knots when switching to a different color? Are there jamming problems?\n Answer:","completion":" I had no problem changing yarns as long as the weight was correct. DK was great. Worsted was more difficult. Didn't try bulky but I doubt the machine could handle it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I had recently purchased a knitting machine,different company and type. It constantly skipped stitches. Is this one better?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it will with some yarns more so than others. But it's easy to watch and prevent it. I actually missed it once and was upset when I saw it many rows later because it isn't like you can just go back so, again if you slow down and watch it's preventable. Hope this answered your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anybody successfully made a sock from fingering weight yarn on this machine? I see conflicting answers and thought I'd ask again.\n Answer:","completion":" I have not nor would I recommend it. This machine was made for a worsted weight yarn and even then it's a looser knit. If you used a finger weight\/sock weight it would be like knitting those with a size 10.5 needle, which is fine if that's the look you're going for. The other problem I would see is the super fine yarn can be a bit difficult to slip so I could see the machine catching on it or things going awry like dropping stitches, etc.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you make a blanket with this?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes you can make a blanket with this machine by joining the strips together.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can a 9 year old use it?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: First of all can you ma.ke newborn sized hats, and if you can is it possible to put a ribbed edge on them?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this machine make socks for a small-footed adult?\n Answer:","completion":" I would think so.. the tube is not very big and if you use a yarn that is tight, it should be good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with a paint brush?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Will some colours be repeated? I don't want to risk having more than 1 repeated colour.\n Answer:","completion":" The set I bought had 3 repeats. Considering the cost per half pan, still a really great deal. Go to \"Daniel Smith\" art supplies, order the empty half pans to add whatever color you like from tubes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: best way to hold pans into case and where to mark the colors so they can be easily identified.\n Answer:","completion":" I often take a small amount of wet paint and paint the bottom of each pan. When it dries it usually holds the pans in place...also some hot wax can be used. You don't want to actually glue them as you may want to replace them one day. As to organization? I keep them pretty much in the order they came unless the color families have gotten disconnected. That way I can see the difference for instance between a warm or a cool red or blue, lemon yellow on one end of a line and cadmium or chrome yellow next then the earth tones in an order from light to dark so that yellow ochre is at one end by the yellows and burnt umber at the other so ochre, raw sienna, burnt sienna, raw umber and burnt umber line up. I simply become familiarized with my colors. Anyway, that's how I do it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Which set should I buy, the set of 12 or the set of 45? I am not a professional artist this is just a hobby.\n Answer:","completion":" This is absolutely an individual, personal decision. From the set of 12, you can easily mix the colors on the open palette spaces to create whatever color you want as all primary colors are represented. On the other hand, if you like to keep the colors free and not have mixture on the individual paint cakes, and you prefer variety, you can get the 45 and enjoy a greater set from the beginning. I purchased the 45 and was happy with that decision!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are these professional artist paints, I don't want student grades\n Answer:","completion":" No, the Cotman line from Winsor & Newton is their student grade line, and it contains 40 paints. Their professional line is called Winsor & Newton Professional Watercolours, and they cost much more than Cotman watercolour sets. For example, the Winsor & Newton Cotman field kit of 12 colours costs approximately $50, whereas the Winsor & Newton Professional Artist's field kit of 12 colours would run approximately $100 or more. I've been a visual artist\/creative professional for nearly twenty years, and I've been using Winsor & Newton products (as well as several other brands) for even longer. The Cotman watercolour line, while being a student grade line, is still very good quality; in fact, there are some professional artists who use Cotman (I've seen portraitists and botanical artists who choose Cotman specifically because it handles well with the way they work), while many others prefer the dense pigmentation of the Professional line. It's all a matter of personal taste and your preferred method of working. In my opinion, this Cotman set would make a fine addition to any artist's media stash. Tip: to get the most vibrancy of your pan colours, spritz them with a little water (or put a small drop of water on the pan colour\/s you'd like to use), and let it sit for a moment to moisten and activate. After it's moistened, when you go to use that colour, you'll experience a vibrancy that can rival some professional paints.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does the palette detach? Not the lid, but the side that has 8 wells.\n Answer:","completion":" No, but every pan does.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone tell me the exact measurements - in inches - of this palette when opened?\n Answer:","completion":" closed it is 4.5 x 10.5 inches. opened all the way it is 10.5 x 12.75 45 half pans. Some of the reds, blues, yellows and browns are duplicates...which is why I bought mine...I'm using it to refill my smaller field kit. I found it to be cheaper to buy this large studio set than individual half pans in quantity.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Hi I am from Mexico this watercolors interest me , let me know if they can be shipped to my country and what is the cost of shipping ?\n Answer:","completion":" Hello. Thank you for inquiry. Shipping is free. Other expenses, you do not need.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you send to mexico city ?\n Answer:","completion":" Thank you for inquiry. Of course I can send.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: Would it be safe to use on furniture?

I know and have heard of many people doing their whole couches & chairs & ottomans. So I would do it. You will probably have to empty the lint catcher a few times, so pay attention. Start out at an inconspicuous part of the chair and see what you feel is the best pressure for it and if it snags or anything so you can let up on the pressure. If it seems to stop working in any way, take the blade cover off and remove any lint\/fuzz around where the blade spins from & the blades. I either blow into it (pointed slightly down so as to avoid fuzz in the face) or I use canned air to give it a good blast of air. So I hope that helps! Give it a try & I bet your chair looks like new! I do my sheets while they're on the bed! Good Luck!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: how do you frame the sheet of a canvas pad?\n Answer:","completion":" I usually mask the edges with masking tape to get a really crisp clean edge and then mount the painting behind a mat with the edge showing. Another way. if you are painting with oils, is to protect the back with greased paper and masking tape before you begin painting. The finished painting can then be glued to a cradled panel - not wrapped around, or it can be wrapped around a panel and glued at the back. the panel can then be framed conventionally. Personally, I like to cut the sheet into 4, mask all around to give a white border and then frame the individual pieces in equal sized frames with a wide mat and hang all 4 together - 2 side by side with the other 2 underneath and about 1 cm gap between the frames. I find this way of working is most successful when the frames are quite a bit larger than the little paintings inside.\n"}

Sue Mitchell, Ft.Pierce, FL.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am a beginner, will these be good?\n Answer:","completion":" They are good needles for a beginner because they are easy to see and sharp for going through certain fabric without leaving a tear or run.., but the eyes for threading are very small, takes a little concentration or get a needle threader to help you..\n"}

Never researched it but would figure that SOMEWHERE there is an obscure chart with the load ratings. I have used this size for years for sail covers, window\/rain flaps for boat enclosures and tops with no obvious failures of the snaps. Proper installation & spacing will insure best results.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I want to attach fabric to a plastic surface. The plastic is 3mm thick. Will these buttons work in this situation?\n Answer:","completion":" On the package it says for jackets, coats, skiwear and boat covers. We do not know if it will work with your 3mm plastic or not, since the plastic will not compress at all like the other things that it mentions does.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i use these on a leather belt?\n Answer:","completion":" I don't see any problem using them on a leather belt. Make sure to punch the hole through the leather first with a leather puncher, the hole diameter should be slightly smaller than the snaps, then install the snaps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: WILL THESE WORK WITH OLD METAL PLIERS?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you need a special tool to attach these?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. This is one, best for things that are not deep into the project. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dritz-Heavy-Duty-Fastener-Plier\/dp\/B005BB5GYS\/ref=pd_bxgy_ac_text_y If the snaps will be located to far into the project for the plyers to work, then you'll need something like this http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/General-Tools-1265-Fastener-Fasteners\/dp\/B00004T7VT\/ref=pd_sim_ac_9 You may want some kind of tapered punch set to open up a space for the snap and help guide it into place, especially if you're going through heavier, or multiple layers of fabrics.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a size 3 brush?\n Answer:","completion":" yes\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you know the diameter and length of this brush?\n Answer:","completion":" Depends on the size you order - and there is also a Series 7 \"Miniature\" that is numerically sized using similar size designations, but - being intended for miniature work - is significantly smaller.

{"prompt":"Question: Is the bonding tape lite enough for silk repair?\n Answer:","completion":" The problem I see is that the heat necessary to melt the adhesive will burn the silk. It happened to me when I tried to use it on polyester. Cotton was just fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this be written on with a permanent marker?\n Answer:","completion":" It's white and smooth and I can't see why not! Incidentally, the patch is still holding up just fine, on my sheet:)\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can this tape repair a small hole in the pocket of a pair a of pants?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it can. I used it to to mend a cigarette burn hole in a duvet cover...just iron it on! Not sure if your pocket it a jean pocket or an outside pocket either way it irons right on and covers your hole.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a tear in a pair of dirt bike pants. They are polyester. I am worried the iron will melt the pants. How hot does the iron need to be?\n Answer:","completion":" Not that hot. Put your iron on a med. setting before applying. Try placing the iron first on the fabric before you put the tape on.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can i use this product to bond a fabric batch onto a shirt without it tear up during wash\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, I have applied it many times to shirts and even cotton tops and after washing it stays in place.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this tape made to adhere on only one side or is it sticky on both sides of the tape. want to attach denim patch onto denim, and don't trust the iron on patches strength alone for hold.\n Answer:","completion":" One side only, with white background, so you will have a white line after finishing.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: can you set the eyelet with a crop-o-dile eyelet setter?\n Answer:","completion":" I am by no means an expert on eyelets. I purchased the setter that came with the eyelets and it worked great. I am not familiar with the one you mentioned.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how to install dritz large eyelets\n Answer:","completion":" there is a tool in the packet and you need a quite heavy hammer. first cut a hole into the fabric, put the upper and lower eylet, one part of the tool on the bottom, one on the top, an then hit with the hammer, first softly, then harder.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what is the fabric content?\n Answer:","completion":" 87.5% Natural Cotton 12.5% Polypropylene. Don't use to make microwave potato bags!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this easy to pull apart like say if I wanted to use it to stuff little stuffed animal type things I've made rather than using it as a sheet?\n Answer:","completion":" No\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I use this to cover my front yard for a snow-like scenery?\n Answer:","completion":" You could.... but it wouldn't be your most realistic-looking choice. The cheaper, high loft batting would be much better suited for a snowy ground effect.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can I cover my front yard with this to give a snow-like scenery?\n Answer:","completion":" Do not look like snow to me just flat\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this product 100% cotton?\n Answer:","completion":" Well, I don't have a lab or anything but since it smells like cotton, looks like cotton, and even feels like cotton, my guess is YES it must be cotton, all cotton and nothing but cotton. ;) Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is thickness?\n Answer:","completion":" Quite thin - about 2mm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are there spools in the box that the bobbins sit on or are they just long open spaces? Wish they had more pics.\n Answer:","completion":" No . . .just long space with dividers. Nothing to prevent bobbins from spinning and thread to become tangled each time it's moved. Consider the Bobbin Saver, which holds bobbins tight in a donut shape so they can't spin off thread. I threw this case away after dealing with the messy tangled thread each time I needed a bobbin.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: does it fit 15j style\n Answer:","completion":" Yes lots of room.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can you give me the measurements of this box please\n Answer:","completion":" It's about 3\" x 6\" and 1.25\" high.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: would the box hold sewing machine brothers bobbins?\n Answer:","completion":" I have a brother's and assuming all the bobbins are the same I would say yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: so, that means they sell empty without bobbins?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes empty!!\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: will thes bobbins fit the brother machine&gt;\n Answer:","completion":" I was fooled into thinking the box came with bobbins in it too, nope! Gotta buy the bobbins seperate.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this case fit the SA156 sewing machine bobbins (Brother machine)?\n Answer:","completion":" I do believe almost any bobbin should fit into this case. I have two different brands of machines and the case will hold bobbins from both machines. lynnakamamadawg\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: my bobbins are extra-large; they are unique to the Bernina 830 (1-inch in diameter and just under 3\/8\" thick) Will they fit?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine are large too and they fit. Look at the circular ones too. They are very handy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it show detailed instructions on how to use the lacer?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes, but I have not chosen to use this piece of equipment that was supplied with this kit. I am using woolen fabric and like a curved large-eyed needle better for stitching\/lacing the braids together. The illustrations and steps suggested in the booklet are very good and when followed, gives the participant confidence to do it successfully. I am glad I ordered this kit and have shared it with several people, even to demonstrating the use at a fiber retreat last October. Thanks. Lee Bates\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: do you need a sewing machine?\n Answer:","completion":" There is some stitching required when joining strips of material but you could do that hand if you don't have a machine.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The reviews are very confusing. Some say nothing came but a book, others say everything was included. So how are buyers to know?\n Answer:","completion":" I found a book, a needle and string in my kit, basically what was advertised to be in there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: rug braiding supplies\n Answer:","completion":" If this is a question that is asking for rug braiding supplies, does that mean that you are inquiring about this particular starter kit? If so, the directions are very good to excellent about creating braided rugs, mats, placemats, etc. The little metal cone that folds thin fabric is good for that, but for thicker fabric, it isn't sufficient. That part is done best by hand folding and pressing with a hot steam iron. The needle for lacing is good if you have no other large curved needle for upholstery work or if that style. Overall, I think that this kit is worth the money in that it has excellent illustrations in the diagrams and photos in the book, answers many questions you would think of while trying to do this craft. I am glad I purchased mine and intend to make many more items using this kit. Hope this helps answer your question.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this kit include the metal pieces that help fold the fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes it does but they are different that the bias tape makers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it come with extra blades. If not, do the scissors dull?\n Answer:","completion":" No, it came with no extra blades. I've used it mostly on cloth but also on paper and cardboard. No sign of dulling yet. The motor will slow down on cardboard, but it keeps on moving.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How well do these cut thru standard corrugated cardboard?\n Answer:","completion":" I have not used them for that. We use them on oak tag which is a heavy card stock.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Do you think these would cut through burlap ??\n Answer:","completion":" I have used it on heavy denim so I think it would do burlap, but maybe only a single layer. I did the denim single layer because two layers really bogged it down. Hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Are the batteries replaceable?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine is in use daily, with regular recharging, and the need for a battery change has yet to occur. These don't appear to have a provision for changing batteries, but if they are kept properly recharged, I doubt that even most regular users will need to change them for a long time. I've owned dozens of electric scissors over the years, some good, some terrible, and these are, by far, the best I've owned. I can't directly answer the question, but I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this a good cutter for those hard to open clamshell packaging? If not what do you think is?\n Answer:","completion":" Yes!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone cut faux fur with this? My daughter likes to make animal tails.\n Answer:","completion":" Yes. I have cut faux fur and leather and much, much more. These are the best $50 that I spent and will continue to purchase from Amazon. I am a professional quilter and use these primarily for cutting batting for my customer quilts but every once in a while husband borrows these for cutting heavy material in his \"man cave\".\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The charger light glows red when plugged into the wall socket. It never turns green even when the cutter is fully charged. Is this normal ?\n Answer:","completion":" No. When you first plug the adapter into the wall it should glow green. Then when you place the scissors on its cradle it should turn red. When the scissors are fully charged, which can take three hours, The light should turn green again. The first one I got was doing what you described. Rather, the light was sort of flickering between green and some funky pinkish color. Even though it was charging the scissors, not knowing for sure that it was fully charged was making me nuts. I had bought it on Amazon, so I just called them up and they were happy to exchange it for another, and the replacement did what it was supposed to. When your question came in, before I answered, I double checked the owners manual on their website. I hope this helps. And by the way, I love love love the scissors.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has this happened to anyone? Bottom scissor \"blade\" started moving after about 30 minutes of use cutting 3 layers of 1mm fabric\n Answer:","completion":" There is a plastic tab that holds the bottom blade in a stationary position. The bottom blade will move when the tab breaks. I bought new blade heads but the tab broke on them also. I don't recommend this product.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: is the quilt warm....\n Answer:","completion":" very! after trying other kinds i,ve found this brand to be the warmest and its light weight.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you use this for hand quilting?\n Answer:","completion":" I am no expert but the qualities of warm and natural allow for both hand or machine quilting. Minimal shifting between the layers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I am looking for the old fashioned cotton batting my grandma used. Is this similar? Her quilts would be very cold at first, then warm up\n Answer:","completion":" I am presently using this 100% cotton batting in a quilt but have not finished.... but so far, the batting is as advertised and very easy to use. I have every confidence that when finished, the quilt will be warm. A finished quilt would not be any warmer than the air temp. allowed; but would warm up when used due to body temp.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is the batting white? Also, has this been pre-shrunk?\n Answer:","completion":" The batting is an off white color. As to it being pre-shrunk, I do not know and the package does not say. However, I have used this batting for several years now on all of my quilting projects and several have been washed repeatedly without any noticeable shrinkage other than how a quilt normally looks after the first washing. I love this product and would highly recommend it for quilting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: is warm and natural needled cotton with polypropylene safe to use in the microwave for \"microwave bowls\"?\n Answer:","completion":" No it is not 100% cotton only 87 1\/2 %, the polymer fibers will burn. Had problems with this batting in my potato bags. Read contents very carefully before buying.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: For rugs, do you have to brush the product on the entire back, or will it be sufficient to brush the 4 corners only?\n Answer:","completion":" I did squiggly \"S\" lines from one side to the other. Never thought to only brush the four corners. Also used it to repair the rubber backing on a bathroom rug and it did a fine job and has lasted through machine washings.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is this product made from?\n Answer:","completion":" Call Environmental Technology (707) 443-9323 - see their web site http:\/\/eti-usa.com\/contact\/\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have some carpet remnants that I would like to use for area rugs on my laminate floors. Will this work to prevent the floor from being scuffed up?\n Answer:","completion":" It works great on rugs of any size. Needs 2 coats to work well. My floors have not been scuffed up, so I guess it works as a anti-scuffer as well as being a non-slip rug product. I love this product but be sure to paint it on outside as the fumes and smell are bad until it dries. I also use it on the bottom of slippers I have knitted or crocheted as a non slip surface.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this product washable after it has dried?\n Answer:","completion":" yes, the rug is washable\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: A few questions: How quickly does it dry? Is there an odor when applying? How quickly does the odor dissipate? Thank you in advance.\n Answer:","completion":" You must wait for a nice warm day, take the rug outside and clean off the old padding well. It can be put on with an old paintbrush. It takes a few days to dry WELL. It all depends on the humidity, too. I cannot stand fumes at all, but it was not bad since I was outside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How many rugs (4x6) will one 16 oz container do?\n Answer:","completion":" One jar will probably cover two 4x6 rugs if you paint around the edges and then just stripes through the middle of the rug. That is what I did. One reviewer talked about not having to cover the back of the rug completely and it still worked great. I found that to be true. I have used three jars now, covering all kinds of rugs. It's great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this product have an odor once it's dry?\n Answer:","completion":" It does have an odor. It's really stinky when putting it on, so make sure there's plenty of airflow. After it's dry, it will have an odor, but when it's on the floor and you're walking around, you won't notice it. It's only when you're really close to the rug that you'll be able to smell it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: How does this product hold up over time: months and years, not days and weeks?\n Answer:","completion":" Years? I don't know. I painted a bunch of rugs last summer and they are all doing great. I painted bathroom rugs that I tore the old rubber backing off, repainted bathroom rugs that had this type of latex originally painted on them and those rugs are probably 15 plus years old. I painted hall rugs that are bound carpet pieces, and kitchen rugs of various types. Many backings and all rugs were slipping around a lot. None of them slip any more. This stuff is great. Painted the rugs outside, let dry 24 hours (inside) before using them. Painted backs in stripes to make jar go farther.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it washable?\n Answer:","completion":" yes!\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can you tell me, is this product clear or white when it dries?\n Answer:","completion":" Mine dried clear.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: why cant the company answer and give me the info I want does it work as well to keep the cold out too or is it only for heat\n Answer:","completion":" Perhaps they prefer you simply scroll down the page and read the description they provided where they answered your question even before you asked. Doesn't anyone read anymore?\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: can it be used for making microwave tortilla warmers\/potato bags?\n Answer:","completion":" No, Insul-Brite cannot be used in the microwave.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: what constant heat temperature can this withstand?\n Answer:","completion":" I have used it in casserole carriers to take to pot luck dinners where it sits for over an hour. The dish from the oven was baked at 400 degrees, then immediately placed in the carrier. The dishes are always still hot when opening the carrier. I use the potholders and oven gloves I make using this, and have never been burned, even bringing out dishes that were baked at 400 degrees and are piping hot and bubbling. I have also used the table toppers with very hot dishes on them at my dining room table, which is a very NICE wood table. No problems, ever! I make the toppers bigger than the dishes I set on them, just in case the dish bubbles over. Then throw them in the washer, dryer and they are all ready to work hard again, never leaving any burns on the table, hands or carriers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: The ad states No thickness...but two dimensions...Which is it? 9.7 x 2.4 x 14 inches?? OR 36W x 45L?? Also HOW THICK?\n Answer:","completion":" It's 36 by 45. It's very thin. I like it very much.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is it machine washable on it's own or do I have to put it between two other pieces of fabric?\n Answer:","completion":" Their own description claims: \"No pre-wash necessary, Machine wash and dry.\" There were no qualifications about how you washed it in a washing machine, so wash it normal like anything else.\n"}

{"prompt":"Question: which side up?? for pads to put in cat beds\n Answer:","completion":" directions packed with the product tell you which side is up--shiny side vs. non\n"}

I would like to know what the dimensions are, both for stone itself and for the handle.\n Answer:","completion":" There is NO handle on this flat stone. It measures: 3.25\"X1\"X1\/4\" thick. Comes in a nice leather case.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: What is grit number of this stone and what kind of stone is that? synthetic or natural?\n Answer:","completion":" It does not indicate on packaging what the grit might be or the grinding stone composition. However, it appears to be A super fine grit and is man made. I have been using it with great satisfaction for sewing scissors, both industrial and regular home scissors.\n"}

You may want to email the company and ask them . I use mine on all my scissors and knifes and so far it works very good. BUt I have just cheap scissors and knifes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Is this Fiskars or Gingher brand? The Title says Fiskars but the image is of a Gingher scissors sharpening stone.\n Answer:","completion":" It is not the same if it is not a Gingher, the dressmaker's shears are so expensive that I wouldn't use anything else but the recommended sharpening stone, the Gingher G-S.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: how do you sharpen the Gingher scissors?\n Answer:","completion":" I take mine to a professional knife sharpner at a quilt shop if they are very dull or nicked, I also use the edge sharpener I purchased from Amazon, my husband does it for me\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Can anyone explain how to use this? New to sewing &amp; bought this but not sure how to use it ??Help plz any info will help ! thanks\n Answer:","completion":" Happy to! Helps tremendously to sew a straight, even seam. Just set it on the needle plate to the right of the needle (the needle plate is the metal piece that the needle goes up and down through the hole and the feed dogs come up under it) place it as far from the needle as you want your line of stitching and it guides the fabric through perfectly as you sew. I absolutely love this thing!! Here's a link to visual dictionary with parts o' sewing machine: http:\/\/visual.merriam-webster.com\/arts-architecture\/crafts\/sewing\/sewing-machine_1.php Here's a video: this product comes up about 40 sec part: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KtKL6mwSRQI\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a computerized embroidery\/sewing machine. Won't this interfere with the computer components?\n Answer:","completion":" On the back of the package says not to use on computer sewing machines.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: I have a pattern that requires a 1\/5\" seam allowance. would this work\n Answer:","completion":" Please have a look at this video https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tByXPGwvZ_I to see how a seam guide is used; think of this magnetic seam guide as corresponding to the piece of tape shown in the video. 1\/5\" is a very peculiar measurement. I don't know of a ruler that would show 1\/5\". But I figured that 1\/5\" is about 5 mm, so you can use a millimeter ruler to measure such a distance. On my sewing machine with the needle positioned in the center of the presser foot, 5 mm from the needle would fall under the pressure foot. So the only way I could sew a 5 mm seam would be to move the needle away from the center position, setting it so that it is 5 mm from one edge of the pressure foot. Then I could use the edge of the presser foot as the seam seam guide. So for such an odd seam allowance, this magnetic seam guide would not work unless you have a very narrow presser foot. That said, this is a wonderful seam guide for measuring seam allowances of more conventional widths.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does it matter what type of foot you are using?\n Answer:","completion":" The only thing going against the guide should be fabric, so the type of foot should not matter. CAUTION: I would not use on computerized machines. Magnets and electronics do not play well together...\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Has anyone used this with Brother SE400? If so, any problems with it?\n Answer:","completion":" I purchased one and use it occasionally. It has a good magnet and since I have an older Viking machine, which is metal; it does hold well. Since my sewing is predominately quilting using a 1\/4\" seam, I use my 1\/4\" seam presser foot more than the seam guide.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Question; Can I use the magnetic sewing gauge on a new machine?\n Answer:","completion":" Hi, Does your new machine have a metal throat plate? ( that is the plate that goes under the sewing foot which the needle passes through as it goes down and catches the bobbin thread) If you have the metal plate the Dritz Magnetic Seam Guide should work with not problem. The great thing about the magnetic guide for me is when I sew a hem in place or have a seam that is deeper than one inch I measure out from the needle to the depth of the seam or hem and attach the guide to the metal throat plate and as I sew the edge of the fabric is sliding through against the guide and I have a perfect seam. Good luck with your new sewing \"toy\" and have fun sewing ! I hope this answered your question. Happy Sewing Ells3\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: brother cs6000i\n Answer:","completion":" Although you haven't really asked a question, I suppose you want to know if the seam guide will work with this machine. All I can tell you is that if the needle plate is a magnetic metal (see item 9 shown on p. 6 of your manual), it should work. You could test by seeing if any magnet sticks to it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Question: Does this have emery sand in it to sharpen pins &amp; needles?\n Answer:","completion":" No it does not.\n"}
